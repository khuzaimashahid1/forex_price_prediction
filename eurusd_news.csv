Investing.com - The greenback picked up steam on Friday despite U.S. consumer optimism hitting its lowest level since Donald Trump was elected president and the government shutdown moving into its 28th day.
The dollar was supported by a stronger-than-expected report for U.S. industrial production in December, in which manufacturing posted an impressive 1.1% gain from November. Such positive surprises relieve some of the worries about the strength of the economy after the slowdown at the end of last year. They also underline the relative strength of the U.S. compared to the Euro zone, where the Bank of Italy warned Friday that the country may have slid into recession with a second straight decline in GDP in the fourth quarter of last year.
However, the negatives for dollar sentiment haven't gone away: Congress and Trump continue to struggle with their impasse over the budget and over 800,000 federal workers remain furloughed. The shutdown could have negative impacts on the economy, business leaders have warned this week as they presented their quarterly earnings.
The shutdown is clearly having an effect on U.S. consumers already: the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center that consumer sentiment plummeted to a two-year low of 90.7 in January from 98.3 a month earlier.

The dollar also continued to be supported by a Wall Street Journal report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in favor of easing tariffs on Chinese products. That sent U.S. stocks and the dollar higher late on Thursday, despite the Treasury Department denying the news.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock indexes rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 supported by gains in U.S. bank stocks after strong earnings, while the pound edged up ahead of a no-confidence vote in British Prime Minister Theresa May's government.
Investors saw potential for legislative deadlock forcing London to delay its departure from the European Union following the parliamentary defeat of May's Brexit deal late Tuesday. The no confidence vote is expected at 1900 GMT.
May is expected to survive the vote, sponsored by the main opposition Labour Party. Expectations of a softer Brexit - perhaps incorporating the Labour Party's idea of membership of a permanent customs union - gave support to the pound.

On Wall Street, strong earnings from Bank of America (N: ) and Goldman Sachs (N: ) as well as a multibillion-dollar deal in the fintech sector kept stocks in positive territory.
""The fact that JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Citi laid the groundwork for bank earnings not being as bad as markets thought made it easier for Goldman and Bank of America,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) rose 149.65 points, or 0.62 percent, to 24,215.24, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 10.4 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,620.7 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 33.52 points, or 0.48 percent, to 7,057.35.
The dollar rose against the euro as the euro zone single currency was pushed lower by worries about the zone's economy, with the euro ( ) down 0.11 percent to $1.1402.
Earlier this week, data showed Germany barely escaped a recession in the second half of 2018 and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned on Tuesday the euro zone economy was weaker than anticipated.
In sovereign debt markets, British government bonds underperformed versus German peers in early trade.

The dollar edged lower against a basket of the other major currencies amid heightened investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates this year
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was last at 95.21.
After a stellar 2018, in which the greenback gained 4.3% due to the U.S. central bank hiking rates four times, investors now expect the Fed to halt its monetary tightening policy.
Market participants think that worries of slowing domestic and global growth as well as tame U.S. inflation will make Fed policymakers hesitant to raise borrowing costs in the world's largest economy.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated last week that the U.S. central bank has the ability to be patient on monetary policy given that inflation remains stable.
Data on Friday showed that U.S. consumer prices in December fell for the first time in nine months in December.
The euro was holding steady, with changing hands at 1.1471.
The pound edged lower, with dipping to 1.2832 at the start of what is expected to be a highly volatile week.
Prime Minister Theresa May must win a vote in parliament on Tuesday or risk a chaotic exit for Britain from the European Union. The numbers are not in May's favor and her chances of winning the vote look extremely slim.
""The market is widely expecting the vote not to pass through parliament. Upside in sterling looks capped at $1.2940,"" added CMC's McCarthy.

Traders should be cautious until seeing next week’s China growth data and U.S.-Q4 earnings notes Bob Savage.
As we learned from FOMC Powell yesterday, the FOMC can be patient on one hand and nervous on the other with inflation data central to their pause in tightening along with financial conditions.
The rally in equities this week balances against the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report this morning. The role of oil bouncing with equities and the role of better U.S.-China trade talks supports renewed global growth views and adds to the one-handed risks for today. Against this we have the U.S. government shutdown, the weakness in retail sales and autos in China and Europe and the ongoing uncertainty from emerging markets.
One has to respect the calendar in the week ahead, and remember it won’t be until Friday that we get the full picture – with China growth data and U.S.-Q4 earnings— for why a one-handed market seems particularly scary. All that puts the stories from overnight into perspective with weaker Japan household spending, lower EcoWatchers survey, smaller current account surplus, weaker Italian industrial production, weaker UK industrial production all pointing to trouble in Q4 that sets the momentum for Q1 and beyond. The risk barometer to watch isn’t the (CNY) – its expensive here – nor is it the euro ( ) at 1.15 as the ECB looks as confused as the FOMC. Rather, the safe-haven story to respect should it start to move today or next week is the Japanese yen ( ) with 107.50 the pivot to watch for a return to flash crash 105 barriers."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was under pressure early on Thursday on growing expectations the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening cycle this year, while optimism about the Sino-U.S. trade talks reduced demand for safe-haven assets.
Minutes from the Fed's Dec.18-19 meeting revealed that several policymakers were in favor of the US central bank keeping rates steady this year.
Broader market sentiment was also bolstered in early Asian trade amid signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Trade tensions between the world's two largest economies had rattled markets for most of last year.
""The Fed has acknowledged market concerns with its language. The markets are clearly reading into this as a more accommodative stance,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
""Optimism on US-China trade talks is also bolstering risk sentiment...the sharp rally in oil prices is also indicative of the fact that global growth fears were probably overdone,"" added McCarthy.
Commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar have been the biggest beneficiaries of improving risk sentiment this week. The fetched C$1.3206, hovering near its highest level in more than a month thanks to a sharp rebound in oil prices.

The dollar had gained 4.3 percent in 2018 as the Fed hiked rates four times on the back of a strong domestic economy, falling unemployment and rising wage pressures.
The euro ( ) and sterling each gained marginally on the dollar, fetching $1.1547 and $1.2794 respectively. However, traders expect the strength in both these currencies to fade in the coming weeks.
Economic data in the eurozone has remained consistently weaker than estimates over the last few months, especially in France and Germany, the eurozone's economic powerhouses. The European Central Bank is widely expected to remain accommodative in 2019, which should keep a lid on the single currency.
Brexit woes are most likely to dominate sentiment towards sterling. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May must win a vote in parliament to get her Brexit deal approved or risk seeing Britain's exit from the European Union descend into chaos. The vote is now due to take place the week beginning Jan. 14.
May's chances of winning the vote look slim as the DUP, the small Northern Irish party that usually props up her government, is opposed to the deal.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar , often considered a barometer of global risk, was steady at $0.7170. Aggressive monetary stimulus measures in China and well as hopes of a concrete U.S.-Sino trade deal have supported the dollar.

Fed members indicated they could afford to be ""patient"" about future rate hikes, citing a list of concerns including volatility in financial markets, slowing global growth and muted inflation pressures.

While Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said the Fed can afford to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy, but added that rates could move higher if ""downside risks dissipate.""
The dollar was also knocked by a stronger sterling despite British Prime Minister Theresa May suffering an early setback to her Brexit plans ahead of a key vote in parliament next week.
British lawmakers voted in favor of a measure forcing May to provide alternative Brexit plan sooner rather later, should the prime minister's plan get voted down.
The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with an alternative plan for Brexit, if the current plan fails to get enough votes on Jan. 15. But it now would have to submit it within just three working days.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar eased against some of its peers on Wednesday, as hopes of progress in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute boosted commodity-linked and riskier currencies.
Increased risk appetite helped lift the Australian dollar after U.S. government officials said that trade talks between China and the United States will continue for an unscheduled third day on Wednesday.
The rose 0.2 percent to $0.7152, after touching a three-week high of $0.7172 in early trading on optimism around the Sino-U.S. talks. The Australian dollar is often seen as a proxy for Chinese growth because of Australia's export-reliant economy and China being the country's biggest destination for its commodities.
""The big slowdown in Chinese growth and the U.S. equity market 'catching up' to equity market weakness seen elsewhere...provide some incentive for a negotiated agreement to take place within the next few months,"" noted Jason Wong, senior markets strategist at BNZ Markets in Wellington.
The rally in risk assets has accelerated since last Friday when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he was aware of risks to the economy and would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year.
The ( ), which measures the greenback against a basket of six peers, gave up 0.1 percent to 95.787 in early trade.
The index, which gained 0.2 percent during the previous session, hovered close to an 11-week low of 95.638 touched early this week.
Against the yen , the dollar was basically unchanged at 108.73 yen per dollar.
""The market became too pessimistic about the global economy up to the beginning of the year, but it seems this kind of pessimism is fading,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""The recovery of market sentiment will continue. In that context, I think dollar/yen will gradually strengthen and will rise to 110.""
Elsewhere, the euro ( ) gained 0.2 percent to $1.1457, but its rebound was not big enough to recover a slightly steeper loss booked during the previous session on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy.
An unexpected fall in German industrial output for the third straight month weighed on the euro overnight. The drop was modest, but it underscored concerns about a slowdown and the European Central Bank's caution as it tries to wean the region off stimulus.
The British pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.2742 on the day. Traders expect sterling to remain volatile over the next few weeks due to Brexit woes.
""I think there will be another drama. Uncertainty dominates again over sterling. It will face downward pressure and the euro will suffer as well,"" said Mizuho's Yamamoto.
The British parliament is due to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit agreement on Jan. 15, and the run-up is likely to dominate trading in sterling. May is set to lose the vote unless she can convince opponents within and outside her party to back her deal."
26,2019-01-09,Could EUR/USD break higher,"Some economists think the U.S. economy may have hit peak growth, which is bullish for the euro reports Fawad Razaqzada.
Although slightly lower today, the has been holding its own rather well despite continued weakness in Eurozone data. In part, the exchange rates resilience has been due to ongoing weakness in the dollar rather than euro strength as investors have been lowering their expectations over further interest rate increases in the United States, while Eurozone interest rate expectations haven’t moved much recently. While we are unsure about the longer-term direction of the EUR/USD, we think there is a possibility that the exchange rate could appreciate further in the short-term outlook.
The recent sell-off in the stock markets underscore concerns over economic growth, as do the disappointing sales forecasts from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and now Samsung (KS: ) for their smartphones. Demand has been hit by the recent currency crisis in several emerging market economies, the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports and tighter monetary conditions in the United States, among other factors.
Although employment growth is still strong and wages have picked up, some economists think the U.S. economy may have hit peak growth as the impact of the past tax cuts start to fade away. The Federal Reserve has indicated it wants to pause hiking and assess the economic situation before deciding whether to tighten its belt further. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank continues to expect lifting interest rates after the summer, should economic conditions still warrant it.
Also painting a moderately bullish picture for the EUR/USD is the fact that the German-US 10-year bond yield spread has widened in favor of Germany (see chart below). Yield-seeking investors are finding European assets marginally more valuable than U.S. assets, underpinning demand for the single currency. In fact, the yield spread has created a divergence as it has made a higher high, while the EUR/USD hasn’t created a corresponding higher high yet. This is a major warning sign for the EUR/USD bears as it indicates the exchange rate may have catching up to do. Note that the previous divergences saw the EUR/USD eventually go in the direction of the yield spread. What makes this particular divergence even more interesting is the fact that the EUR/USD has held its own above long-term support around the 1.13 handle and created a couple of interesting price candles on its monthly chart.
Source: TradingView and FOREX.com.
So, the potential is there for a breakout on the EUR/USD despite all the doom and gloom out there. But overall, price action on this pair is still (understandably) choppy and range bound. Conservative traders may therefore wish to wait for more signals to emerge before taking a directional view on the EUR/USD. Friday’s US CPI and next Tuesday’s Brexit vote in the UK parliament are among the most important short-term catalysts for this pair."

The U.S. Labor Department's latest (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in November declined to about 6.9 million, missing expectations of 7.1 million.
The weaker job openings print did little to sway investor expectations that the U.S. labor market remains robust as data last week showed the economy created more jobs than expected in December.
The dollar was also supported by a fall in Treasury prices, which trade inversely to yields, even as analysts said U.S. government bond yields have likely peaked.
Goldman Sachs cut its year-end projection for the 10-year Treasury yields by 50 basis points to 3%, while Bank of America also trimmed its forecasts on the 10-year yield to 3%.

Monday morning and the reaction function of writing new ideas on an old computer conspired to break the deadline. Big hopes dwindled into a harsher, slower reality, writes Bob Savage Monday. He's presenting at TradersExpo New York March 11.
The here and now continues to drift into a bearish winter drizzle as the there and then of 2018 hangs over the market blurring any forecasts for sunshine and growth.
There are always surprises to consider in the space between now and then with technology the first risk for bears while the forces of demographics and fear of radical change block the bulls. This is a market stuck waiting for something new and different.
The illogical inconsistencies roll on – with oil up 2% and European equities lower even as the news overnight was mixed. Retail sales better, German factory orders worse, Australian and Japan PMI reports weaker while German construction better.
The Sentix report on investor sentiment captures the present mess best with global downturns and dire warnings on policy makers to respond. The central bank reaction function remains the key doubt driving fears for 2019. The trust of the market in Powell’s new found “patience and flexibility” and renewed focus on financial conditions may change like the time.
There is a feedback loop inherent in data-dependency, which kills volatility. The role of the USD weakness in the present situation can’t be ignored.

By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A set of strong employment data in the United States, decisive action from the Chinese central bank and dovish messages from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell combined to push world stocks further off recent lows on Monday.
The resumption of talks between the United States and China on tariffs also helped bring back some optimism to a market battered in recent weeks by trade tensions and a weakening global growth outlook.
European shares held on to Friday's strong gains after a stellar opening for Asian bourses, pushing MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, to its highest level in 2-1/2 weeks. It is now 6 percent higher than its December trough.
""It is a reminder that central banks still have some firepower to deal with lower growth prospects, and perhaps what we are also getting some return of liquidity as investors return from the holidays and the ability to think things through,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw.
He warned, however, that there is continued uncertainty about global growth, trade talks between the United States and China and U.S. monetary policy.
""There are a number of questions that remain unanswered,"" Shaw said.
On Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls data showed the world's largest economy added 312,000 net new jobs in December, while wages rose at a brisk annual pace of 3.2 percent, both way above expectations.
This, along with a 100 basis point cut in China's bank reserve requirement ratios and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would be flexible in its approach in 2019, has been the main driver for the recovery.
The boost to stock markets saw them recapture all the year’s losses and push into positive territory for 2019 so far, with Wall St's main indices closing up more than 3 percent by the close on Friday.
After gains of more than 2 percent in Shanghai and HK on Friday before the U.S. jobs data and Powell's comments, both markets added almost 1 percent more on Monday. Japan’s reversed Friday’s plunge to gain 2.4 percent.
European stocks were more or less flat across the board, though mining stocks ( ) surged 1.1 percent after the reserve requirement ratio cut from China boosted metals prices, especially steel and iron ore.
This renewed optimism saw U.S. Treasury yields rise off recent lows, and two-year yields move back above the federal funds rate to 2.485 percent.
That is nearly 50 bps below the November peak, however, suggesting there is still plenty of nervousness around growth prospects for the U.S. economy.
""Clearly markets are now pricing in the risk of a cut in 2019,"" said Shaw of Investec. ""That's a big shift given until relatively recently when we've been focusing on rate hikes.""
BUYING THE DIP?
Some of the stocks recovery may be attributed to investors buying stocks once again in the belief that the market had bottomed out or had overshot in pricing in global risks.
In any case, Friday was a strong session for Wall Street, with the Dow ( ) recording gains of 3.29 percent, while the S&P 500 ( ) jumped 3.43 percent and the Nasdaq ( ) 4.26 percent.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) researchers expect a bounce in equity markets in 2019.
""If, as we expect, global economies slow down in 2019 but avoid recession, and U.S. interest rates peak, there is likely to be a risk rally,"" they said in a note.
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) said that with 2,055 of 2,767 U.S. and global companies in a bear market, it might be time to buy.
""Our Bull & Bear Indicator has fallen to an 'extreme bear' reading, triggering the first 'buy' signal for risk assets since June 2016,"" they wrote in a note.
The U.S. dollar -- which served as a safe haven in 2018 -- fell broadly, with the euro edging up to $1.1442 ( ) and the ( ) easing 0.3 percent to 95.90.
The currency could not even hold early gains on the yen, lapsing back to 108.21 .
Gold benefited from the diminished risk of U.S. rate hikes and rose half a percent to $1,291.12 , just off a six-month high.
Oil prices firmed after Brent bounced about 9.3 percent last week. The crude benchmark ( ) rose 118 cents on Monday to $58.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures ( ) gained 93 cents to $48.89."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell for a third consecutive day against its rivals on Monday on growing bets the U.S. central bank will press the pause button on its rate hike cycle in the coming months.
Notwithstanding strong monthly U.S. jobs data for December last week, market watchers believe the world's biggest economy is losing momentum with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's comments adding to expectations the central bank may adopt a more cautious outlook.
On Friday, Powell told the American Economic Association that the Fed is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and that it will be sensitive to the downside risks markets are pricing in.
Against a basket of its rivals ( ), the dollar declined a quarter of a percent to 95.92, nearing a 2-1/2 month low hit last week.
""Growing expectations that the Fed will pause on its rate hike cycle is weighing on the dollar and that will be a big factor in the coming days,"" said Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London.
The dollar outperformed other currencies in 2018 due to the Fed being the only major central bank to hike rates. If the Fed holds rates in 2019, analysts see slim chances of further greenback appreciation. Money markets expect no more rate hikes from the Fed this year.
The euro ( ) and the Australian dollar led gainers with the latter also benefiting from the weekend news of growing policy stimulus in China.
After a slew of weaker-than-expected manufacturing data, Chinese authorities on Friday cut reserve requirements for all banks by 100 basis points. The move frees up $116 billion for new lending as it tries to reduce the risk of a pronounced fall in the pace of economic growth.
The Australian dollar , whose fortunes are closely correlated with China, gained half a percent to $0.7140.
The dollar advanced 0.2 percent versus the to 6.8483.
Financial markets are also optimistic about U.S. officials meeting with their counterparts in Beijing this week for the first face-to-face talks since President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping on Dec. 1 agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar lost ground against the other major currencies on Monday as comments from the Federal Reserve eased concerns over its policy tightening and the start of a fresh round of U.S.-China trade talks boosted risk appetite.
Two days of trade talks kicked off in Beijing on Monday following the announcement Friday of new stimulus measures by the Chinese government, aimed at addressing a sharp economic slowdown.
Investors hope that Washington and Beijing can strike a before the end of a 90 day truce in the trade war.

On Friday, Powell said the Fed is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and that it will be markets are pricing in.
Despite Friday's stronger than expected , many analysts believe the world's largest economy is losing momentum and further rate hikes are the last thing it needs. Powell's comments that the central bank is ""prepared to shift the stance of policy"" boosted investor sentiment and sent U.S. stocks soaring on Friday.
The dollar outperformed other currencies in 2018 due to the Fed being the only major central bank to hike rates. If the Fed holds rates in 2019, analysts see slim chances of further greenback appreciation.
U.S. and Treasury yields fell sharply over the last couple of weeks indicating that bond traders see little chance of the Fed raising rates this year on the increased likelihood of a growth slowdown in the world's largest economy.
However, few analysts still see scope for the Fed to raise rates in 2019.
""Last Friday's strong US jobs data suggested that recession fears were overblown,"" said Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS in a note.
""With the Fed only looking to pause rate hikes, the market is likely to have gotten ahead of itself in pushing at the U.S. 2-year and 10-year bond yields below the Fed Funds Rate last week,"" he added.
Wee said he still expects the Fed to hike rates twice this year.
The euro gained ground against the U.S. dollar, with advancing 0.37% to 1.1434.

Investing.com - This week investors will be looking to Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting and a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell a day later as they try to determine the Fed’s outlook on monetary policy.
Last month the Fed voted to increase interest rates for a fourth time in 2018 and indicated that two more rate hikes this year are likely. While investors will be closely scrutinizing the minutes, they will probably be dated following remarks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last Friday.
Powell pledged that the central bank will be watching how the economy performs this year and will adjust policy accordingly.
“As always, there is ,” Powell said. “And particularly with muted inflation readings that we’ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the yen and euro in thin year-end trading on Monday as optimism about progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute hurt its safe-haven allure, but the greenback stayed on track to log its strongest annual performance in three years.
The ( ), which tracks the greenback versus six peers, was down 0.22 percent on Monday.
""The U.S. dollar is heading into the end of the calendar year on the defensive as global stocks — bearing in mind that some markets are done for the year already — perk up following positive comments on U.S.-China trade from President Trump,"" Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said in a note.
Equities around the world rose on Monday as hints of progress on the Sino-U.S. trade standoff provided optimism in what has been a punishing end of year for markets globally.
Risk sentiment brightened slightly when U.S. President Donald Trump said he held a ""very good call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and claimed ""big progress"" was being made.
The two nations have engaged in a trade war for much of 2018, shaking world financial markets as punitive tariffs disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies.
The yen which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation, remained in demand and the greenback hit a fresh six-month low against the Japanese currency .
""We've heard this all before and are still awaiting concrete details, of course,"" said Osborne.
The persistent tensions have boosted safe-haven demand for the greenback this year as investors bet that the United States is in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war.
For the year, the index was up 4.4 percent, its best yearly percentage gain since 2015.
While the dollar has been relatively stable going into the end of 2018, expensive valuation, a flagging equity boom, waning cash repatriation by U.S. companies, and the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates as many times as previously signaled pose a challenge for the greenback.
""We still rather think the U.S. dollar may be peaking after spending much of the past year on the offense,"" said Osborne.
On Monday, the euro ( ) EBS was 0.08 percent higher against the greenback. Although the single currency has gained versus the dollar in recent weeks, economic growth and inflation in Europe remain much weaker than the European Central Bank's expectations.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was down against most of its peers on Wednesday, pressured by a cocktail of negative factors including heightened concerns over a partial U.S. government shutdown and tension between the White House and the Federal Reserve.
Fears of a U.S. and global economic slowdown have sent U.S. 10-year yields tumbling by around 25 basis points in December, adding to the increasing strain on the dollar and further darkening its outlook.
""Moderating U.S. growth and political tensions are negative for the dollar and we expect continued weakness,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
""I expect the biggest winner of global risk-aversion to be the yen.""
The dollar has struggled particularly against the yen, losing ground for eight straight sessions as a broad risk-off move in financial markets benefited the safe-haven Japanese currency. It tried to steady in early Asian trade on Wednesday, edging up 0.1 percent on the yen to 110.43.
Analysts at Mizuho Bank said the sharp decline in U.S. 10-year treasury yields ( ) has dented the dollar's performance versus its peers. U.S. 10 year paper is currently yielding 2.73 percent, having fallen from 3 percent in early December.
The euro ( ) and the British pound tacked on 0.2 percent each, changing hands at $1.1415 and $1.2705, respectively. The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to fetch $0.7043.
Over recent months the dollar has struggled to shake off a growing list of bearish factors, led most recently by speculation over the outlook for U.S. interest rates, falling bond yields and the plunge in oil prices.
Last week, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the fourth time this year, and largely kept to its plans to hike rates next year despite heightened economic risks.
That prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to step up his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, with the public tussle between the White House and the Fed rattling investors.
Trump blasted the Fed on Monday, describing it as the ""only problem"" for the U.S. economy.
The partial U.S. government shutdown has also added to investor worries about the growth outlook. The U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the shutdown could continue until Jan. 3."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc on Tuesday as investors cut their exposure to riskier assets amid the partial U.S. government shutdown and signs of confrontation between the White House and the Federal Reserve.
The dollar fell 0.39 percent to 110.00 yen , its lowest level since late August and is set to fall for an eighth straight session against the Japanese currency, with London and New York shut for Christmas.
The yen also hit a 16-month high against the British pound, trading at 139.90 yen ( ) and a four-month high against the euro, at 125.60 yen ( ).
The Swiss franc rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to a 12-week high of 0.98355 to the dollar , extending its 0.9 percent rise on Monday, its biggest daily gain in 11 months.
Gold rose to a six-month high of $1,269.30 per ounce on Monday.
U.S. stocks plunged more than 2 percent while oil prices sank more than 6 percent in a holiday-shortened Monday trade, as developments in Washington added to investors' concern about a slowdown in the global economy next year.
""People are saying this is a black Christmas,"" said a veteran currency trader at a major Japanese bank.
Wall Street's volatility index ( ), which measures the implied volatility of stocks and is often seen as a fear gauge for investors, jumped to 36.10, the highest since Feb. 6, when it briefly shot up to as high as 50.30.
U.S. President Donald Trump blasted the Federal Reserve on Monday, describing it as the ""only problem"" for the U.S. economy, only days after reports surfaced that Trump had discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
""If talk of firing Powell becomes more realistic, that would undermine the Fed's independence as a central bank and ultimately confidence in the dollar,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
As a sell-off in equities escalated, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hosted a call with the president's Working Group on Financial Markets, a body known colloquially as the ""Plunge Protection team"".
But holding such a meeting, which is normally only convened during times of heavy market volatility, did little to soothe the market. Some said the move may have backfired by hurting investor sentiment.
Trump also sparred with top Democrats in Congress over the partial shutdown of the U.S. government on Monday, with no sign of tangible efforts to reopen agencies.
Washington's latest problems come on the heels of a major sell-off in global shares since early October on worries about Sino-U.S. tensions, higher U.S. interest rates and a waning boost from Trump's tax cuts to the U.S. economy.
With many markets closed for Christmas, moves in other currencies were limited. The euro was little changed at $1.1410 ( ), having gained 0.33 percent on Monday.
Commodity currencies faced fresh pressure as oil prices tumbled more than 6 percent on Monday.
The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.3584 per U.S. dollar , having hit a 19-month low of C$1.3614 on Monday."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was lower on Monday, starting the week on the backfoot as sentiment in financial markets remained fragile on heightened worries over political instability in the United States.
Trading volumes were thinning out with most global markets set to shut for Christmas. U.S. markets close early Monday, Christmas Eve, and are shut Tuesday for Christmas Day.
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.2% at 96.25 by 3:45AM ET (09:45 GMT).
Market focus will stay attuned to developments out of Washington DC after the failure by the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump to agree to a spending bill by midnight Saturday resulted in a partial U.S. government shutdown.
, Trump's budget director and chief of staff, warned on Sunday the shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes, and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.
Meanwhile, reports that President Trump suggested firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that could roil already volatile financial markets, will also be in focus.
U.S. Treasury Secretary tweeted late Saturday that Trump had told him that never suggested dismissing the Fed chief.
The U.S. central bank lifted rates for the fourth time this year last week and kept most of its guidance for additional hikes over the next two years, drawing the ire of Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the Fed's tightening as damaging to the economy.
Elsewhere, the greenback was weaker against the yen, with losing 0.25% to trade at 110.97.
The euro pushed higher, with rising 0.2% to 1.1395.
The pound was also higher, with advancing 0.2% to 1.2669 amid an ongoing political deadlock over Britain’s efforts to exit the European Union.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks were subdued on Monday as investors fretted that political instability in the United States was leaving the country rudderless at a time when the global economy was showing signs of faltering.
Moves were limited by a holiday in Japan while many bourses are set to close early for Christmas. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) lost 0.5 percent to its lowest in seven weeks.
Yet Chinese blue chips ( ) managed to edge up 0.2 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ( ) recouped early losses to rise 0.4 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue into January, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.
Trump on Sunday said he was replacing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis two months early, a move officials said was driven by the president's anger at Mattis' resignation letter and its rebuke of his foreign policy.
Sources also told Reuters Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin felt it necessary to personally call the heads of the six largest U.S. banks to calm nerves and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the ""Plunge Protection Team.""
""It provides more than enough fodder for perceptions of chaos and instability in the White House,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
""At the same time, the government shutdown offers a true foretaste of what lies ahead once the new Congress in sworn in on January 3.""
GLOBAL SLOWDOWN
The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds.
The Nasdaq ( ) has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high and into bear territory, while the S&P 500 ( ) was on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.
At the same time 10-year Treasury yields were near their lowest since August at 2.79 percent , having fallen over 40 basis points in just six weeks.
The gap between two- and 10-year yields has shrunk to only 14 basis points, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded economic turning points in the past.
""Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,"" warned Simon MacAdam, global economist as Capital Economics.
""This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.""
The flight to safe havens was again boosting the Japanese yen, with the dollar near a three-month trough at 111.02 yen on Monday.
It fared better on the euro, which was undermined by a run of poor data out of Europe. The single currency hovered at $1.1376 ( ), after being as high as $1.1485 last week.

By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar languished close to one-month lows on Friday, seemingly pressured by year-end positioning with financial markets whipsawed by a collapse in oil prices, sell-off in equities and a threat of a U.S. government shutdown.
A day after the Federal Reserve raised policy rates and delivered an outlook that was less dovish than traders had anticipated, the liquidation of heavy long positions in the dollar in markets thinned by holidays seemed to be the only explanation for the dollar's weakness.
The safe-haven Japanese yen benefited from the brittle sentiment. The against a basket of six major currencies stood at 96.421 after falling to 96.168 overnight, its lowest since Nov. 20. The index has lost roughly 1 percent this week.
Investors have been on edge all week on rising risks to global growth, with the plunge in oil prices sending a strong disinflationary pulse and extending a slide in U.S. Treasury yields.
That has kept the dollar on the back foot even as the less dovish Fed helped it stave off a potentially bigger sell-off.
The U.S. currency underperformed particularly against the yen as global stock markets sank as investors worried about the Fed's plans to continue raising rates despite heightening risks to growth.
MSCI's gauge of global stocks ( ) has declined nearly 4 percent this week, touching its lowest since April 2017.
The dollar, which began the week above 113.00 yen, stood at 111.415 . It had dropped 1 percent to 110.815 overnight, its weakest since Sept. 6.
The greenback has lost nearly 1.8 percent against its Japanese peer this week, the largest weekly decline since mid-February.
""Dollar/yen buckled as factors which fed risk aversion mounted to extraordinary levels, with the having fallen several hundred points day after day,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street (NYSE: ) Bank.
""A lot of the moves in dollar/yen has been technically driven in December. There was strong support at 112.00 yen and when that finally gave way, the dollar's descent gathered pace rapidly. A strong yen, however, does also mean opportunities for Japanese investors to buy foreign assets.""
High currency hedging costs have prompted a move by Japanese investors towards unhedged foreign bonds. Japan's life insurers have expressed a desire to move purchase unhedged foreign bonds when the yen appreciates.
""We are seeing a classic case of 'risk off' lifting the yen against the dollar, something that had not taken place so often in the recent months,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ( ) was at 2.804 percent after sliding to 2.748 percent overnight, its lowest since early April.
""Whether the dollar can find a floor depends largely on if Treasury yields can pull back from their decline,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.
""But currently that is not a realistic scenario. It would take an end to the U.S.-China trade conflict or some more U.S. fiscal stimulus for Treasury yields to rebound, neither of which are likely to happen soon.""
Adding to pressure on the dollar was news that U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless he got money for a border wall, risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday.
The euro was 0.05 percent higher at $1.1449 ( ) after nudging up to a 1-1/2-month peak of $1.1486 the previous day. The single currency was headed for a 1.4 percent gain on the week.
The pound inched was little changed at $1.2660 .
Sterling had climbed to a 10-day peak of $1.2707 on Thursday but pulled back from the high after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold, saying Brexit uncertainty had ""intensified considerably"" over the last month."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell toward a 10-day low on Thursday against its rivals as concerns grew the United States may be heading for a sharp economic slowdown next year despite the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the fourth time in a year.
Although U.S. policymakers have said they may raise interest rates three times by early 2020, the U.S. bond yield curve -- a widely considered indicator of future recessions -- flattened to 10 basis points and just a shade above a 11-year low set earlier this month.
An inversion of the bond yield curve is considered a sign of economic recession with longer-term yields falling below shorter-dated maturities and those concerns triggered a global selloff in risky assets such as stocks and high yielding currencies like the New Zealand dollar .
""We are seeing some messy markets in currencies this morning and the dollar is struggling to gain traction after the Fed decision,"" said Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ) in London.
The dollar fell 0.4 percent ( ) against its rivals to 96.68 and within a whisker of a 9-day low of 96.554 hit in the previous session.
Indeed, while the Fed's 'dot plots' now signal two, instead of three, rate hikes for next year, the market is unconvinced and is barely pricing in one increase in a reflection of heightened market concerns of the state of the global economy.
While the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point, China's central bank rolled out a policy tool to spur lending to small and private firms in a move that some analysts termed as equivalent to a targeted rate cut.
The Japanese yen advanced half a percent, changing hands at 111.92 on the dollar and poised for fifth straight day of gains. In a widely expected decision, the Bank of Japan kept rates steady, maintaining its ultra-loose monetary settings.
The euro led gainers ( ) in London trading with the single currency advancing nearly half a percent against the dollar at $1.1428.
The single currency was supported by news Italy had struck a deal with the European Commission over its contested 2019 budget
and some solid trade data this week.
Sterling gained a third of a percent to $1.2658. The Bank of England is due to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Thursday, where markets expect the central bank to stay on hold.
Elsewhere, Sweden's currency jumped more than one percent against the dollar on Thursday after the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than seven years.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar was steady in Asian trade on Thursday, and was off its overnight lows after the Federal Reserve rowed back from a more aggressive policy tightening path even as it gave markets the impression of being much less cautious than they had anticipated.
In a widely anticipated decision, the U.S. central bank hiked interest rates by 25 basis points and forecast fewer rate increases next year than it had at its September policy meeting.
Yet markets were surprised by the Fed's commitment to retain the core of its plan to tighten monetary policy, despite rising uncertainty about global economic growth, sending Wall Street stocks tumbling and depressing Asian equities.
""Investors had braced for the worst - from no rate hike to dissents and a change in the risk assessment,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management.
""And while there were subtle tweaks in the statement and lowered growth and inflation forecast, these changes were not as significant as the market had hoped.""
Indeed, while the Fed's 'dot plots' now signal two, instead of three, rate hikes for next year, the market remains unconvinced and is barely pricing one increase in a reflection of the slowdown in global growth.
The ( ) was a touch higher at 96.99 in early Asian trade, managing to recover from an overnight low of 96.55 and the New York close of 96.97 as markets came to terms with the Fed's outlook.
""Forward guidance was much more balanced relative to the market dovish expectation. This should prove moderately positive for USD risk heading into the New Year,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia at Oanda.
In a press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the expected two hikes for 2019 weren't set in tone.
""There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for us to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so,"" Powell told reporters.
Oanda's Innes expects the dollar to strengthen against commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar , which fell one percent overnight to its lowest level since Nov.1. The dollar was last fetching $0.7108.
The yen weakened by 0.1 percent against the dollar, changing hands at 112.57, having gained for four days in a row. The focus for yen traders will be on the Bank of Japan's rates decision later in the day, though policy makers are widely seen maintaining their ultra-loose monetary settings.
The euro ( ) gained 0.1 percent on the dollar to $1.1385. The single currency was supported by news Italy had struck a deal with the European Commission over its contested 2019 budget.
The dollar was steady after losing 1.2 percent overnight, and falling briefly on weak economic data. It was last at $0.6775.

The Fed is expected to increase rates by 25 basis points for the fourth time this year at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT). Investors will be watching for any new comments on possible policy changes in 2019 and poring over forecasts for next year, also known as the dot plot.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would signal plans to slow its pace of interest rate raises at a keenly-watched meeting later in the day.
Fed policy makers are widely tipped to raise rates for a fourth time this year but also to express caution about future monetary tightening due to concern about slowing global growth.
Expectations of a pause from the Fed amid a U.S.-China trade conflict and global financial market volatility has led some investors to question if the dollar's stellar run will continue into 2019.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly berated the Fed and on Tuesday said in a Tweet it was ""incredible"" for the central bank to even consider tightening given global economic uncertainties.
""A hike is still likely, regardless of Trump's displeasure, but there's a very good chance that they will reduce the number of hikes in 2019 to two (from three),"" said Kit Juckes, global head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (PA: ).
The safe-haven yen and the Swiss franc both strengthened as an overnight plunge in oil prices provided a stark reminder of the dimming prospects for the global economy.
Risk sentiment has been soured by weaker-than-expected economic data out of China and the eurozone.
The yen and the Swiss franc each added a little more than 0.1 percent on the dollar, changing hands at 112.33 and 0.9916 respectively, building on three consecutive days of gains.
The ( ) was down 0.3 percent at 96.77, hovering near a one-week low as it extended losses into the second day.
Elsewhere, the euro ( ) hit a one-week high of $1.1405, gaining 0.3 percent. The single currency has enjoyed a rare uptick in the past three sessions as the dollar grappled with lower yields and monetary policy risks.
The same reasons gave the Australian and New Zealand dollars a lift, with both of them gaining 0.2 percent to $0.7195 and $0.6864 respectively.
The euro was also supported by news that Italy had struck a deal with the European Commission over its contested 2019 budget, signaling an end to weeks of wrangling that had shaken financial markets.
Comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in late November that the key interest rate was “just below” neutral, a level that neither brakes nor boosts the economy, have bolstered investor expectations that U.S. central bank is nearing a pause on its monetary tightening.
However, some analysts still see the Fed raising rates 2-3 times in 2019.
""Personally, I think the Fed will continue to normalize policy next year and I don’t think it will send the U.S. economy into recession,"" said ACLS analyst Marshall Gittler.
""An economy where there are more job offers than unemployed persons doesn't need such super-stimulus. That's why I remain bullish on the dollar,"" he added.
According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, the probability of a December rate hike is 69 percent, down from around 75 percent last week, a significant move in such a short period."

The U.S. central bank will also release new forecasts for economic growth and interest rates, known as the , as investors look for greater signs of the Fed's likely rate hike trajectory through 2019 and beyond.
While policymakers have pointed to three increases in 2019, the market is starting to bet the U.S. central bank may halt its rate hikes altogether next year as risks to the U.S. economy mount.
However, some analysts still see the Fed raising rates 2-3 times in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as the dollar weakened, with investors betting that growth concerns will prompt the Federal Reserve to slow its pace of interest rate hikes at this week's meeting.
A rout on Wall Street following a spate of weak data globally has strengthened the view that the Fed's widely-expected rate hike on Wednesday will usher in a slowdown, or even a pause, to three years of steady rate increases.
The prospect of a ""dovish rate hike"" is keeping the dollar - this year's best performing major currency - in check.
That is helping the euro ( ), which on Tuesday was up 0.2 percent at $1.1373, having recovered all of its losses from Monday when it was hit by weak euro zone data.
The European Central Bank's assessment last week that the balance of risks was moving to the downside, combined with signs that protests in France are beginning to weigh on business, means that euro appreciation is still a few months away, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) analysts.
Markets will scrutinize the Fed's two-day policy meeting, which starts Tuesday, for its sense of how the economy is holding up amid a U.S.-China trade conflict and global financial market volatility.
""We expect the trade-weighted dollar to remain flat today, with a more meaningful catalyst for larger USD moves being the FOMC meeting tomorrow,"" said ING FX strategist Petr Krpata.
The mood on Tuesday was less positive for the greenback with the ( ) 0.2 percent lower at 96.931 after losing 0.4 percent on Monday.
Last week, the dollar enjoyed its best weekly performance since September, reaching an 18-month high. The euro weakened after the European Central Bank cut inflation and growth forecasts and struck a cautious tone about the outlook for the world economy.
It may not be all gloom for the greenback. Some analysts think dollar strength can return if the Fed remains relatively confident about next year's monetary tightening path.
""Personally, I think the Fed will continue to normalize policy next year and I don’t think it will send the US economy into recession,"" said ACLS analyst Marshall Gittler.
""An economy where there are more job offers than unemployed persons doesn't need such super-stimulus. That's why I remain bullish on the dollar,"" he added.
In a tweet overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump took another swipe at the Fed saying it was ""incredible"" for the central bank to even consider tightening given the global economic and political uncertainties.
The markets, however, looked past Trump's now-familiar comments on the Fed.
The yen gained about 0.3 percent on the dollar as investors' fears of slowing global growth increased demand for safety assets. The Swiss franc , another safe haven, also tacked on 0.2 percent.
Sterling , which has been heavily sold off in the past few months on Brexit uncertainty, held steady at $1.2653.
The firmed to $0.6845, buoyed in part by improved business confidence data.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slid lower against a currency basket on Tuesday ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting while the yen remained supported amid concerns over the outlook for global growth.
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, edged down to a one-week low of 96.42 by 03:30 AM ET (08:30 AM GMT).
With the Fed widely expected to deliver its fourth rate hike this year at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday moves in the dollar will be guided by its forward guidance.
""We are expecting a dovish hike by the Fed. The data has not been tepid enough for the central bank not to hike in December,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB.
Senior Fed officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, have recently become more cautious about the policy outlook that underlined a shift in market sentiment from a few months ago on rising signs of a slackening in the global economy.
While the U.S. central bank's latest median dot plot projections from September indicated its willingness to raise rates three times in 2019, the interest rate futures market is pricing in only one more rate hike for 2019.
This mismatch largely reflects a belief that higher U.S. borrowing costs will likely hurt U.S. growth and ultimately force the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes.
The U.S. economy, which has been growing strongly this year, has started to show signs of fatigue, adding to growing evidence elsewhere including in Europe and China of cooling momentum.
Yet it may not be all gloom for the greenback. Some analysts think dollar strength can return if the Fed remains relatively confident about next year's monetary tightening path.
""Most investors expect the central bank to be less hawkish so if the Fed makes it clear that further rate hikes are needed and there's still scope for 3 rounds of tightening, the dollar will soar regardless of Powell's concerns about the economy,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy in a note.
In a tweet overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump took another swipe at the Fed's expected rate increase this week, saying it was 'incredible' for the central bank to even consider tightening given the global economic and political uncertainties. The markets, however, looked past on the Fed.
The greenback was weaker against the yen, with losing 0.31% to trade at 112.48 as risk aversion underpinned safe haven demand.
The traditional safe haven Swiss franc also gained ground, with dipping 0.13% to 0.9916.
""The Japanese yen and Swiss franc are likely to take on the mantle of safe havens from the greenback for the time being,"" NAB's Catril said.
Yen traders are also focusing on the Bank of Japan's meeting on Dec. 19-20, at which it is widely expected to keep policy ultra-loose as inflation remains well below its target.
The euro pushed higher, with rising 0.19% to 1.1367.
The pound was also higher, with advancing 0.32% to 1.2657 amid an over Britain’s efforts to exit the European Union."

In September, the Fed projected three rate increases for next year, but some are expecting the Fed policymakers to signal just two rate hikes for next year as the boost to the U.S. economy from President Donald Trump's tax cuts begin to wear off and as global growth continues to wobble.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 18-month high on Monday, bolstered by safe-haven buying as heightened concerns of a global economic slowdown reduced appetites for riskier assets such as stocks and Asian currencies.
Weaker-than-expected economic data from China and Europe and fears of a possible U.S. government shutdown spooked investors away from stocks toward the greenback and yen.
""The dollar is clearly showing it is attractive during times of market stress,"" said Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at NAB in Sydney.
The ( ), which gauges its value versus six major peers, was little changed at 97.44, below the near 18-month high of 97.71 it hit on Friday.
The Australian dollar , whose fortunes are closely tied to China's economy, was marginally lower at $0.7174. It lost 0.3 percent of its value last week as data showed Chinese November retail sales grew at the weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years, underlining risks to the economy.
The offshore was flat at 6.8974.
Apart from fears of a global economic slowdown, markets are also focusing on the likely trajectory of U.S. monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its two-day meeting that opens Tuesday.
The central bank has lifted rates eight times since December 2015 in a bid to restore policy to more normal settings after having slashed borrowing costs to near zero to combat the financial crisis a decade ago.
With the hike largely factored in by the market, larger moves in the dollar will be guided by the Fed's forward guidance.
According to their projections in September, the median view among the Fed's policymakers was for three rate hikes in 2019. However, interest rate futures used to gauge the probability of further hikes are pricing in only one hike in 2019.
""Any content that speaks to the difference between market pricing of one interest rate rise in 2019 versus previous Fed indications of three rises is very likely to move markets,"" Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based chief markets strategist at CMC Markets, said in a note.
Traders believe that higher U.S. borrowing costs will likely hurt U.S. growth momentum and ultimately force the Fed to pause its monetary tightening path.
Recent comments by Fed officials have also been read as dovish by some analysts. Last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said rates were near the range of policymakers' estimates of ""neutral"" - the level at which they neither stimulate nor impede the economy.
""The Fed will most likely move from an auto-pilot mode to being data dependent,"" said Attrill.
The dollar gained 0.1 percent over the yen in Asian trade to trade at 113.48. Interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan make the dollar a more attractive bet than the yen, according to some analysts.
The Bank of Japan has a meeting on Dec. 19-20, at which policy is expected to remain highly accommodative as inflation remains well below the its target.
The euro ( ) was also little changed at $1.1310, having lost 0.6 percent last week after weaker-than-expected data out of France and Germany suggested that economic activity in Europe remains weak.
Sterling remained under pressure in Asian trade, down 0.02 percent at $1.2582. British trade minister Liam Fox said on Sunday talks with the European Union to secure ""assurances"" for parliament on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal will take time, with a decision expected in the new year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar firmed against most major counterparts on Friday, as investor focus shifted to an expected U.S. interest rate hike next week, although gains are likely to be capped on greater uncertainty about next year's policy outlook.
The greenback found broad support as the euro and pound came under pressure after downbeat comments from the European Central Bank president about the outlook for the euro zone and renewed concerns about a hard Brexit.

The dollar ( ) has been the biggest winner of 2018, having gained 5.3 percent over its peers so far this year. The Fed is the only major central bank to raise rates on the back of a robust economy, accelerating inflation and steady corporate profits.

Investing.com - Despite the fact that the European Central Bank decided to pause on its asset purchase program, its president, Mario Draghi, warned that risks were leaning to the downside, sending the euro briefly to intraday lows.
Draghi commented that recent data had been “weaker than expected” as he announced that the outlook for economic growth was revised “slightly down” in 2018 and 2019 to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The ECB chief insisted that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook “can still be assessed as broadly balanced”.
“However, the balance of risks is moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility,” he added.

The ECB left interest rates at zero and also confirmed the end of additional increases to its €2.6 trillion ($2.96 trillion), four-year-long bond buying program on Thursday.
“Our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim,” Draghi stated.
While the ECB reiterated that rates would not budge until “at least through the summer of 2019”, some analysts have been suggesting that the euro zone central bank may not move until 2020.
“We now expect the ECB to hike interest rates in 2020 and not by late 2019 as currently communicated in the banks' forward guidance,” Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday. “We expect the ECB to change its forward guidance on interest rates in the next few months.”
“With the most prominent crisis-fighting measure of the ECB now almost back in the toolbox, the big question is, what will be next. More action, shelving of the next crisis-fighting measure negative deposit rates or nothing at all?” ING Germany chief economist Carsten Brzeski asked on Thursday.
“At least for now, the ECB’s forward guidance on rates, as well as the reinvestment, have been left unchanged. It seems as if the ECB wants to keep as many cards as possible close to its chest,” he explained."

New tensions between the two countries flared last week after Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of China's tech giant Huawei Technologies was arrested in Vancouver at the request of the United States.

French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country at 2000 Paris time (1900 GMT) on Monday as he seeks to placate the protesters.
In London, Theresa May faces an internal revolt against her Brexit deal ahead of the crucial vote in the parliament on Tuesday. Despite the bleak outlook, May plans to push ahead with the vote while senior lawmakers in her own party piled pressure on her to go back to Brussels and seek a better offer.
A rejection could throw plans for Britain's exit into turmoil and leave her own political future hanging in the balance.
Against the dollar, the British pound edged up 0.2 percent to $1.2746. Against the euro, it changed hands at 89.70 pence per euro ( ), near its weakest level since late September.
""I'd say a rejection is almost priced in and the focus is on by how much margin she would lose. The chance of May's government getting toppled increases if there is a large revolt,"" said Mitsubishi Trust's Fukushima.
The Chinese yuan was on the defensive to after weak data pointed to a further cooling in the world's second-biggest economy.
China's November exports rose just 5.4 percent from a year earlier, the weakest performance since a contraction in March and well short of the 10 percent forecast in a Reuters poll, adding to evidence that demand is weakening globally.
Import growth was 3 percent, the slowest since October 2016, and a fraction of the 14.5 percent seen in the poll.
The downbeat trade data reinforced views that Chinese authorities will have to roll out more support and stimulus measures soon to stabilize the economy, even if a trade deal with Washington is reached.
The yuan last stood flat at 6.8895 to the dollar , having dipped 0.2 percent earlier in the day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar remained under pressure on Wednesday after the U.S. bond market sent worrisome signs about economic growth overnight, adding to fears that the Federal Reserve could put its rate-hike cycle on hold.
The Australian dollar slumped against the greenback on worse-than-expected quarterly economic growth, reversing the early gain booked after China's Commerce Ministry said China and the United States would proactively push forward trade negotiations in the coming 90 days.
Investors remained nervous over an inversion of the yield curve between three-year and five-year U.S. Treasury notes and between two-year and five-year notes.
Analysts expected the two-year and 10-year yield curve, seen as foreshadowing a U.S. recession, to follow suit.
""In the initial phase of the inversion of the yield curve markets are worried about whether there'll be a recession,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.

Still, as long as U.S. two-year yields do not fall substantially, the downside of the dollar against the yen remains limited, Mizuho's Yamamoto said.
""While the Fed officials' comments in the past days have been taken as dovish and the pricing of the rate hikes next year has been reduced, it doesn't change the direction of the U.S. two-year yield, which is on the upside,"" he said.

The curve between 3-year and 5-year notes inverted for the first time since 2007 on Monday. A yield curve is said to be inverted when yields on longer-dated maturity bonds are lower than shorter-dated bonds.
Analysts now fear an inversion of the two-year, 10-year yield curve could be imminent and point towards a possible U.S. recession.

Catril added that U.S. Treasury yields are near crucial technical support levels, a break of which could add further pressure on U.S. yields and the dollar.

However, some analysts warned many issues still have to be resolved for risk sentiment to stay positive in the medium term.
""A lot will depend on developments in the next 90 days, but given the U.S. and China are on different pages, we don't think the optimism can last. We reiterate trade wars need to be framed in terms of who hurts the least and see the G20 meeting as a stronger win for the U.S.,"" said Sue Trinh, head of Asia EM FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.
Apart from trade, investors will also be turning their attention to U.S. monetary policy, ahead of an expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting later this month, which would be the fourth rate hike this year.
""The developments over the weekend will give the Fed more confidence to raise rates in 2019,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC markets.
The dollar was pressured lower last week when the market took comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as an indication that the Fed could slow its program of hiking interest rates.
Powell is scheduled to testify before a congressional Joint Economic Committee later this week.
""We believe that Powell has simply toned down his hawkish tilt seen in October, with the Fed on track to deliver a hike, the fourth this year, at the FOMC meeting on 19 December, as well as another four increases in 2019,"" Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS, said in a note.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar trod water in nervous trade on Friday ahead of a meeting of U.S. and Chinese leaders that might, or might not, lead to a truce in the Sino-U.S. trade war, which would boost emerging market currencies at the expense of safe havens.
The greenback has been under pressure this week on growing expectations that the Federal Reserve would slow down its pace of monetary tightening, a view reinforced by comments on Wednesday from Chairman Jerome Powell.
Despite the dovish comments from Fed officials, there was no large scale dollar sell-off, partly due to the strength of the U.S. economy, weakening growth elsewhere, and dollar's own status as a safe haven amid the Sino-U.S. trade war.
It held steady Asian trade, with an index ( ) measuring its value versus six peers up marginally at 96.72.
The focus is now on a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires between Nov. 30-Dec. 1.
Trump kept markets nervous by sending mixed signals on Thursday about the prospects for a trade deal with Xi.
""If we see a truce, the and dollar will perform exceptionally well. We see a lot of upside in crosses such as Aussie/yen which would benefit from a risk on move,"" said Nick Twidale, chief operation officer, Rakuten Securities.
""If tariffs on Chinese imports stay at 10 percent, the dollar is likely to weaken in a risk-on move,"" he said.
Trump has said he plans to significantly hike the existing 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports by January next year, which would sharply escalate the trade war between the economic heavyweights.
China's economy is already under pressure, with a survey earlier on Friday showing its vast manufacturing sector growth stalled for the first time in over two years in November as new orders shrank.
Apart from U.S.-Sino trade talks, the markets would also be focusing on whether OPEC and Russia agree on oil production cuts next week.
A meaningful rebound in crude prices can be beneficial for commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone according to Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
Dollar investors were also carefully watching for any changes in U.S. monetary policy.
Overnight, minutes from the Fed's Nov. 7-8 meeting indicated that another interest rate hike is warranted. But Fed officials also kept the debate open on when the U.S. central bank might pause its monetary tightening and how it would relay those plans to the public.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in December, which would be the fourth hike for the year.
For 2019, the market is now pricing only one rate hike, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, below Fed's projection of three increases during the year.
On Wednesday, Powell said the Fed's policy rate is now ""just below"" estimates of a neutral rate, which investors interpreted as a signal the Fed's three-year tightening cycle is drawing to a close.
However, some analysts think that the market may be underestimating the number of times the Fed can hike rates next year.
""We believe that Powell has not turned dovish but simply toning down his hawkish tilt. We expect a Fed hike in December and the US economy to keep performing and support another four hikes in 2019,"" said Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS in a note.
The dollar weakened 0.07 percent versus the yen , which changed hands at 113.41 at 0350 GMT. Analysts expect the dollar/yen to remain in an uptrend due to the diverging monetary policies of the Fed and the Bank of Japan.
The euro ( ) was steady at $1.1390, having risen in the last two sessions as the dollar wobbled on Powell's comments.
Elsewhere, sterling traded at $1.2779, losing 0.1 percent versus the greenback. Traders remain bearish on the pound betting that British Prime Minister Theresa May will fail to win approval for her Brexit deal in a fractious parliament.
""No news is bad news for sterling. There's been no meaningful progress in Brexit negotiations and investors are growing impatient,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in a note."

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was flat against its rivals Thursday as the Federal Reserve minutes did little to dent investor expectations for a December rate hike, but added to expectations that interest rates were close to neutral.
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.04% to 94.72.
""Members continued to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,"" the Fed's minutes showed.
But they also added weight to investor expectations that the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate was inching closer to neutral.
""A couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could unduly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations,"" the minutes read.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that interest rates were ""just below"" neutral, dampening the optimism for a more aggressive rate-hike cycle.
Beyond monetary policy, mixed U.S. economic data showing ongoing strength in consumer spending, but a slowdown inflation kept a lid on gains in the greenback.

By Vatsal Srivastava
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar extended its overnight losses on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said U.S. interest rates were just below neutral, taken by investors as a tip that the rate hike cycle was nearing its end.
Powell's dovish remarks took the currency markets by surprise as he noted that the policy rate, at 2-2.25 percent, is now ""just below"" the broad range of estimates of neutral, which in September was 2.5-3.5 percent.
This view represents a significant departure from comments in October when he said rates were a ""long way from neutral at this point"".
The Fed chairman's remarks led to the dollar weakening across the board, especially versus riskier currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars , which both gained 1.2 percent in the previous session.
Some emerging market currencies such as the South African rand < > and the Turkish lira < > also gained 1 percent each.
""Powell's comments were read as too hawkish back in October...to some extent his overnight comments have neutralized that,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB.
""The question now is just how much more dovish markets can get in terms of rate hike expectations. ..investors are now pricing in a December rate hike and only one more rate hike in 2019,"" added Catril.
Traders expect more clues on the Fed's monetary tightening path from the minutes of the U.S. central bank's Nov. 7-8 meeting, due out later on Thursday.
The , a gauge of its value versus six major peers, traded steady at 96.84 in early Asian trade. The index lost 0.54 percent on Wednesday, its steepest percentage decline since Nov 1.
Some analysts think that a pause in rate hikes had become necessary.
""U.S. economic data has been weakening, stocks have been falling and lower oil and gas prices restrict rather than encourage inflation. As a result, consistent rate hikes are no longer necessary,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a note.
""In many ways Powell is stating the obvious by saying what the market is starting to feel already,"" she added.Traders may be cautious of building aggressive short positions, given the G20 summit on Friday and Saturday where U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are scheduled to discuss contentious trade matters.
Catril noted that safe-haven buying could return to the greenback if there were no signs of a truce between Washington and Beijing over the course of the G20 summit.
Trump said this week it was ""highly unlikely"" he would agree to China's request to hold off a planned increase in tariffs for further talks.
The dollar fell 0.15 percent versus the yen to trade at 113.52, but analysts expect interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan to support the dollar/yen.
The euro ( ) changed hands at $1.1368 on Thursday. The single currency gained 0.7 percent in the previous session thanks to anti-dollar flows.
Sterling traded marginally lower at $1.2821. Investors expect the pound to remain under pressure as traders bet that British Prime Minister Theresa May will fail to win approval for her Brexit deal from a fractious parliament.
The Bank of England warned on Wednesday that Britain risks a bigger hit to its economy than it suffered from the global financial crisis a decade ago if it leaves the European Union in a ""disorderly"" manner, which would include a 25 percent crash in the value of the pound."

The , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.31% to 96.99.
""Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy ‑‑ that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,"" Powell said.
With interest rates sitting in a range of 2% to 2.25% and the range of estimates for the neutral rate between 2.5% to 3.5%, RBC said Powell's remarks represented more fact than a dovish pivot, indicating the market reaction was overdone.
""There is no doubt that the market will latch onto the comment where Powell states that rates are 'just below' the neutral range as a dovish development,"" RBC said in a note.
Ahead of the speech, market participants were keen to get sense of whether Powell would moderate his tone on policy tightening amid ongoing criticism from President Donald Trump.
Trump said he was ""not even a little bit happy"" with his selection of Powell as Fed chief, asserting that the central bank was ""way off-base"" with its stance on rate hikes.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar held near two-week highs on Wednesday, as concerns about Sino-U.S. trade tensions propped up safe haven currencies and as investors awaited cues from the U.S. Federal Reserve on the path of future interest rate increases.
The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks on signs the Fed might slow the pace of future rate increases due to slowing global growth, peak corporate earnings and escalating trade tensions.
Attention has now turned to a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell later on Wednesday and the minutes from the Fed’s Nov. 7-8 meeting on Thursday. Markets hope to gain fresh insights into the Fed's thinking on the speed and number of rate hikes in the current cycle.
""We don't think Powell will diverge too much from the Fed's data dependent approach. Our base case remains for the Fed to raise rates 4 times in 2019,"" said Terence Wu, currency strategist at OCBC Bank.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points next month.
In an interview to the Washington Post on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he is unhappy with the Fed's policy stance and Powell, whom he picked last year to lead the bank.
Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and Powell on the U.S. central bank's monetary policy stance, saying rising U.S. rates were harming the economy.
But analysts think it is unlikely that political interference can alter the Fed's approach to formulating monetary policy.
""The Fed relishes its independence and their approach is very mathematical and systematic. Under no circumstances do we expect the U.S. central bank to be pressured by Trump,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading, APAC at Oanda.
In comments made on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida backed further rate hikes though he said the tightening path would be data dependent. He said monitoring of economic data has become even more critical as the Fed edged ever closer to a neutral stance.
""Clarida went back to the usual script and his comments did not contain the dovish overtone as some had expected,"" said Wu.
The ( ), a gauge of its value versus six major peers, traded at 97.38 having risen for three sessions in a row. It is just below this year's high of 97.69.
Dollar strength also reflected risks around the upcoming G20 summit in Buenos Aires between Nov. 30-Dec. 1 where Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are scheduled to discuss contentious trade matters.
Trump's comments this week that it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept China's request to hold off a planned increase in tariffs drove investors to safe-haven currencies such as the dollar and the yen.
The yen hit a two-week low of 113.85 on Wednesday.
""Interest rate differentials between U.S. and Japan are likely to support dollar/yen going ahead,"" added Wu.
The euro ( ) gained 0.07 percent versus the dollar to $1.1295. The single currency has lost 1.5 percent of its value in recent sessions due to signs of weakening eurozone economic momentum and ongoing tensions between the European Union and Italy over Rome's free spending budget.
Elsewhere, sterling was a touch lower at $1.2742. The pound is likely to remain under pressure as traders bet that British Prime Minister Theresa May would fail to get the nod for her Brexit agreement in a fractious parliament.
The Australian dollar , often considered a gauge for global risk appetite, gained 0.15 percent to $0.7231 as Asian equities pushed higher.
However, analysts expect the dollar to remain vulnerable to further declines amid sharp losses in the price of iron ore, a key export earner for the country, and as U.S.-Sino trade tensions showed no signs of abating."

Sterling was weaker ( ) across the board after Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks, Italian bonds and the euro rallied on Monday on signs that Rome was preparing to rework the spending plans that have left it facing formal European Union disciplinary action.
A bounce in oil prices after their 'black' Friday, the survival chances of Britain's newly-sealed Brexit agreement and renewed Russia and Ukraine tensions were keeping traders busy too, but it was Italy that stole the show.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday to brief ministers on her strategy to convince the deal's critics that include the Northern Irish DUP party currently propping up May's government.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell nearly half a percent on Friday after signs that economic growth could be slowing across the euro zone.
Euro zone business growth slowed much faster than expected this month, a widely-watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey showed.
The disappointing readings were hastened by an ongoing U.S.-led trade war and will likely be of concern to the European Central Bank which is expected to draw a line under its 2.6 billion euro asset purchase program next month.
German private-sector growth slowed to its lowest level in nearly four years as factories in Europe's largest economy churned out goods at a slower pace.

The euro also fell 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc to 1.1326 francs. ( )
""Particularly the German PMI was disappointing ... The environment for the euro is getting more difficult,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a Frankfurt-based strategist at Commerzbank (DE: ), pointing to a dispute over Italy’s spending plans and concerns about the bloc's growth outlook.
""The economy in the euro zone has cooled significantly over the past months and unless this is just a brief interlude the European Central Bank might be forced to stick to an expansionary monetary policy,"" she said.
Weakness in the single currency supported the dollar, which rose 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies to trade flat at 96.706. ( )
The dollar has lost ground for two consecutive trading sessions and is drifting lower from a 16-month high of 97.69 hit earlier this month.
Dollar skeptics are concerned about the pace of future interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Both the euro and sterling rose on Thursday after Britain and the European Commission agreed on a draft text outlining how their trading relationship will work once Britain has left the European Union.
But EU leaders still have to ratify the agreement at a summit on Sunday and Prime Minister Theresa May would then have to get a Brexit deal through a deeply divided British parliament.

The latest bout of dollar weakness comes as investors start to question how many times the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates in 2019 without risking a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which has held up so far as borrowing costs have risen.
According to a Reuters poll published on Tuesday, the median analyst forecast is for three more increases next year, taking the federal funds rate to 3.00 to 3.25 percent by end of 2019. But the third rate rise is a close call.
The poll also showed economists now put the probability of a U.S. recession in the next two years at a median 35 percent.
Elsewhere, the British pound was little changed at $1.2775 as traders await clarity on the progress of a Brexit agreement.
""Until an agreement is reached, sterling will remain under pressure because with each passing day, the risk of a no deal Brexit grows,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in a note."

By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday, pushing two-year yields down as much as 23 basis points as markets shrugged off the European Commission's rejection of Rome's draft budget and focused on the possibility of compromise between the two sides.
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini refuted a La Stampa newspaper report that he was open to reviewing the 2019 deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, but said other aspects of the budget could be discussed.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he was worried about Italy's bond spread over Germany and that the government would respond with reforms.
The Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 313 basis points, having widened to 335 bps on Tuesday ( ). It has more than doubled this year.
""There is obviously a hint in the reports from Italy that there might be some tweaks to the budget in due course,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.
""I don't think there will be substantive changes but we did have a significant selloff yesterday, so there's a better mood around bond markets today.""
The European Commission said the Italian budget does not comply with the EU debt reduction criteria and that an excessive deficit procedure is warranted.
While the euro ( ) briefly turned negative and Italy's benchmark stock index ( ) hit a session low on the news, markets soon recovered. Italian bank shares were up 2.5 percent on the day ( ) and bond yields extended their slide.
""We know how negotiations work in Europe and the most likely outcome in this case is that both sides agree on a compromise,"" said Jonas David, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""We may see further negative headlines but at this stage we need to read between the headlines a bit.""
Italy's two-year bond yield fell 23 bps to touch 1.15 percent, the lowest in almost two weeks, while 10-year yields were down 13 bps, falling to about 3.49 percent ( ).
Yields were set for their biggest daily drop in over three weeks, with an improvement in global risk sentiment helping equity markets to stabilize.
Italy's bond price gains also followed hefty losses on Tuesday, caused partly by a ""BTP Italia"" retail debt sale in which small investors took up just 723 million euros ($824 million) of the bonds on Monday and Tuesday. The previous such sale had received orders worth 3.7 billion euros in the first two days.
SKEPTICAL
Many remain skeptical about a sustained Italian recovery, noting Rome had made no significant changes in the revised budget it submitted to Brussels.
""We don't think they're going to budge much. There might be some word play with the Commission, but Italy is still going to run a deficit of 2.4 percent,"" said Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank.
Meanwhile, PIMCO's chief investment officer for global fixed income, Andrew Balls, said the possibility of Italy defaulting on its debt is unlikely but cannot be ruled out altogether.
As Italian yields fell, Greece's bond market also recovered slightly from a heavy selloff in the previous session, with five-year yields down 3 bps ( ).
They had earlier touched the highest in more than two months, coming under pressure from renewed concern about the Greek banking sector and contagion from Italy's volatility.
The Commission said on Wednesday Athens needed to speed up implementation of reforms.
The rally in riskier euro zone bonds dented demand for safer debt, with 10-year German yields rising 2 basis points to 0.37 percent ( ).

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar traded firm against major peers on Wednesday, extending overnight gains as investors shunned riskier assets in favor of safe haven currencies on escalating worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-Sino trade war.
With sentiment souring and a global equities rout on Tuesday, risk averse traders sought shelter in the liquid dollar, which climbed from a two-week low hit earlier on Tuesday.
""What's driving currency markets right now are fears of a slowdown in economic growth with safe haven currencies like the dollar and yen likely to benefit,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
The greenback had been under pressure for most of this week as cautious comments by Federal Reserve officials and surprisingly weak U.S. economic data suggested the central bank could slow the pace of monetary policy tightening.
The ( ), measuring performance against six major peers, was steady at 96.82 on Wednesday. The index gained 0.65 percent in the previous trading session.
""For now, the dollar has retained its safe haven attributes outperforming across the board in the overnight session,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB, in a note.
With the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in December, analysts think the greenback could trade with a positive bias in the short term, despite lowering their longer-term rate hike expectations.
The yen traded at 112.91, with the greenback gaining 0.14 percent. The yen hit its highest level this month on Tuesday at 112.29 per dollar before losing steam as dollar bulls took charge.
Despite its safe haven status, the yen's strength has been muted. Analysts suspect this is because Japanese investors have kept their money in U.S. and foreign markets, rather than bring it home.
The euro ( ) traded with a weak bias at $1.1372. The single currency lost 0.7 percent of its value on Tuesday.
Wider confidence retreated on Tuesday as Italian bank shares hit a two-year low and the spread between German and Italian bond yields widened.
Italy is at loggerheads with the European Commission and many fellow euro zone governments over its expansionary 2019 budget, which breaks EU's fiscal rules.
""The potential for the a further tussle between Rome and Brussels can have an impact on the overall Eurozone economic growth, which will keep the euro under pressure,"" added Michael McCarthy.
The British pound was little changed at $1.2786, having lost 0.5 percent versus the greenback on Tuesday. The pound is seen likely to trade sideways until the market gets more clarity on progress in the Brexit deal.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar eased slightly versus other major currencies on Monday after Federal Reserve officials expressed caution over the global growth outlook, prompting traders to reassess the pace of future U.S. interest rate increases.
The greenback has enjoyed a strong run this year thanks to the Fed's steady policy tightening on the back of a robust economy and rising wage pressures. A fourth rate hike for this year is expected next month and policy makers had indicated two more by June 2019.
But comments on Friday by Richard Clarida, the Fed's newly appointed vice chair, put to the test market expectations for a steady pace of tightening. Clarida cautioned about a slowdown in global growth, saying ""that's something that is going to be relevant"" for the outlook for the U.S. economy.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan, in a separate interview with Fox Business, also said he is seeing a growth slowdown in Europe and China.
The comments may hint that the Fed is set to slow down its pace of monetary tightening and led some traders to question whether the dollar's rally was nearing its end, with the benchmark U.S. 10 year treasury yields ( ) pulling back slightly.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE: ) will speak later on Monday and traders would be waiting to see if he echoes the same theme as his colleagues.

The euro ( ) dipped 0.1 percent in Asian trade, changing hands at $1.1403, having advanced over the last four trading sessions despite weaker economic fundamentals.
The single currency has gained 2.7 percent versus the pound ( ) since Nov. 13 as uncertainty over a smooth Brexit deal remains at the forefront.

The British pound wobbled at $1.2832, having come under heavy selling last week amid turmoil over British Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit plan.
The currency is expected to remain under pressure until the market gets more clarity on the progress of the Brexit deal, CMC Markets' McCarthy said.
In the days since May unveiled a draft EU divorce deal, May's premiership has been thrust into crisis. Several ministers, including her Brexit minister, have resigned and some of her lawmakers are seeking to oust her.
With both pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers unhappy with the draft agreement, it is not clear she will be able to win the backing of parliament for it, raising the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal.

Morgan Stanley’s Global Head of FX Strategy Hans Redeker said the dollar has peaked, pointing to investment flows and what he sees as a slowing economy. Goldman Sachs. also says it will be tough for the greenback to gain. At HSBC, however, the chief currency strategist is seeing vindication for his bullish stance held since April, after the dollar advanced more than 6 percent against the euro.
Bloom reckons the will strengthen to $1.10 per euro by the end of next year -- a 3 percent upside from current levels for the world’s most-traded pair. That’s a weaker euro forecast than any of the 19 estimates tracked by Bloomberg. Bloom is also more dollar-bullish than consensus across a slew of FX pairs, including the South African rand.
Investors are set to gobble up U.S. assets anchored by a robust business cycle that’s sustaining rate hikes, while haven demand may fuel the greenback should traders turn skittish, he said.
Rooting for Euro
Data this week underscore the uphill battle for traders rooting for a rebound in the euro. German output contracted in the third quarter while investors surveyed by ZEW showed little optimism about the prospect of a pick-up -- spurring to 2018 lows.
“It is this theme of ‘divergence’ between the U.S. and everywhere else -- now evident since the first quarter of 2018 and reinforced in the recent data -- that has driven our strong, steady view for the dollar,” Thierry Wizman and Gareth Berry, strategists at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note this week.
Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted U.S. rates over Europe are at some of the highest levels in history, with nominal yields outpacing other Group of 10 nations. All that has helped the dollar rise 4 percent against 10 of its peers in 2018.
The has given the Swiss franc a run for its money this year, benefiting from haven demand during risk-off market trading -- a trend that could intensify in 2019, according to the HSBC strategist.
Third Scenario
Only in a third scenario, where the Fed calls off further hikes, does Bloom see the dollar weakening. “You’ve got a dice with three sides, and only one side loses,” he said.
While arch-dollar bears at Morgan Stanley say weaker equity and credit prices give reason to pare U.S. currency exposures, optimism in the derivatives market has swelled over the past week.
Traders in three-month options have increased their dollar bets versus a basket of six major currencies, risk reversals show. The premium for calls over puts has pulled to within 10 basis points of the 2018 closing high seen mid-August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“No one is more bullish,” Bloom concluded."

The 2.5% to 3.5% range is considered a neutral level that doesn’t stimulate or hinder the economy, he said.
""I think certainly where the economy is today, and the Fed's projection of where it's going, that being at neutral would make sense,” Clarida said.
The Fed is expected to increase rates in December and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have increased expectations that the central bank will gradually increase rates in 2019.

By Vatsal Srivastava
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The British pound struggled to stay afloat in Asian trade on Friday having suffered a tumultuous slide overnight, as investors feared political turmoil in the country could see it crash out of the European Union without a divorce deal.
Both the dollar and the yen benefited from a deepening crisis for UK Prime Minister Theresa May after the resignation of key ministers from her government imperiled her Brexit plan.
That left the sterling vulnerable to further losses. It was changing hands at $1.2792, barely holding steady after declining 1.7 percent on Thursday, its steepest percentage slide since Oct. 11 2016.
""Political troubles are never good for the currency but in the case of the UK, the pound could drop to 1.25 versus the dollar on the prospect of a no deal Brexit, leadership challenge and slower growth,"" Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management said in a note.
The resignations, including that of Brexit minister Dominic Raab, came hours after May had claimed backing for a draft divorce deal. The hostility from government and opposition lawmakers raised the risk that the deal would be rejected in parliament, and that Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a safety net..
May's compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers, thus raising the risks of her losing her job, of Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement or even another referendum.
Without a deal, the UK would move in March from seamless trade with the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states, which could cause panic in financial markets.
However, some analysts believe sterling bulls have a reason not to throw in their towel yet, noting there is a chance of another referendum with the choice between a hard Brexit and remaining in the EU.
A snap Sky News poll yesterday showed 55 percent in favor of another referendum, while 54 percent supported no Brexit, 32 percent a hard Brexit and only 14 percent May's deal.
“A second referendum would likely result in clear vote to remain, a strongly positive outcome for GBP. With that in mind we think the upside tail has fattened more than the downside,” said Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC in a note.
The euro ( ) tacked on 0.05 percent to trade at $1.1338. Investors were hopeful after reports out of Italy said that Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was looking to work with the EU over his government's 2019 budget, which has been rejected by Brussels.
The single currency has gained over the last three trading sessions, but was up only 0.1 percent versus the dollar month to date, underscoring the strains from weakening economic momentum in Europe, Italian budget woes and the Brexit uncertainty.
The ( ), a gauge of its value versus six major peers, was up 0.05 percent at 96.97, not far off a 16-month high of 97.69 hit at the start of the week.
Currency markets were also keeping an eye on the U.S.-Sino trade tensions as traders looked for concrete signs the economic powers were seeking to de-escalate their dispute.
A Financial Times report said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has told some industry executives that another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold. But a U.S. Trade Representative spokesperson later denied this report.
""This is a clear sign of the tussle taking place between the doves and hawks in the trade camp..we will be hearing more of this till the upcoming G-20 meet,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
Most analysts forecast the dollar to remain well supported in coming months thanks to the Federal Reserve's commitment to continue to gradually raise interest rates. A fourth hike for this year is expected next month, backed by a robust economy and rising wage pressures.
The safe-haven yen was well bid in Asian trade, changing hands at 113.34, as the Brexit turmoil drew investors toward the Japanese currency. The yen had hit a six-week low of 114.20 on Monday before reversing course."

Investing.com – The dollar continued to give up gains against its rivals Wednesday following subdued inflation data and a rise in sterling after UK Prime Minister Theresa May secured support from her Cabinet for a draft Brexit deal.
rose 0.18% to $1.3005 after May said that her Cabinet had backed her Brexit plan, adding it was in the national interest but that there would be difficult days ahead.
“The collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration,” May said outside her Downing Street residence after a five-hour cabinet meeting.
“I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom.”
The rise in sterling added to downside momentum in the greenback, which had come under pressure in the wake of a subdued inflation report.

MILAN (Reuters) - Oil prices bounced from multi-month lows on Wednesday but stocks fell as disappointing data heightened worries over slowing global growth, while the pound wavered as Prime Minister Theresa May faced the hard task of selling her Brexit deal.
European shares hit a two-week low after data showed the German economy contracted for the first time since 2015, tracking similar losses in Asia where data in Japan and China underscored worries about weaker growth.
They later pared some losses after Reuters reported that OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut output, helping oil prices reverse opening losses and putting an end to their longest losing streak in decades.
The MSCI's world equity index ( ) remained on track for its fifth day of losses in a row, but reduced its decline to 0.1 percent by 1243 GMT.
The pan-European STOXX ( ) benchmark index was down 0.2 percent, while U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat open.
Sterling fell from the 7-month high versus the euro and eased below $1.30 in volatile trading after being boosted from news that Britain and the European Union agreed on the text of a Brexit divorce deal.
""After 873 days of bickering, point scoring, intransigence on both sides, and seemingly irreconcilable differences, we finally have a deal,"" said Deutsche Bank (DE: ) strategist Jim Reid.
""Now this easy part is out of the way along comes the hard part of selling it to a divided Parliament full of vested interests and factions,"" he added in a note.
Before seeking UK parliamentary approval before exiting the bloc on March 29, 2019, May will try to persuade senior ministers to accept the deal that opponents said would imperil her own government and threaten national unity.
The British cabinet is due to meet at 1400 GMT.
Although sterling softened from peaks hit in the previous session, investors were anticipating wild swings ahead for the British currency. Sterling/dollar implied overnight volatility jumped to 23 percent, its highest since a general election in June 2017.
""We are cognizant that the recent provisional deal is only a step in the right direction and if it does not pass the meaningful vote the opposite scenario is likely to play out,"" said Richard Larner, Head of Research at Brooks Macdonald.
""In this event, investors will begin to price a no-deal situation into investment markets,"" he added.
OIL BOUNCES AFTER LONG LOSING STREAK
Meanwhile, oil attempted to rebound after plunging around 7 percent the previous session, with surging supply and the specter of faltering demand scaring off investors.
The growing prospect of OPEC and allied producers cutting output at a meeting next month however propped up the market, helping U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ( ) trade 0.3 percent at $55.9 a barrel and reverse opening losses.
According to three sources familiar with the issue, OPEC and its partners are discussing a proposal to cut oil output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2019, to avert an oversupply that would weaken prices.
In the previous session, U.S. crude futures suffered 12 straight sessions of losses.
""We went through our archives yesterday and found a bit more daily data back to 1977, and we still can't find a losing run of this magnitude,"" said Deutsche Bank's Reid.
Brent crude oil futures ( ) also bounced, up 0.9 percent, at $66.05 per barrel. In the previous session they hit an eight month low following a 25 percent slide from the four-year high reached early in October.
Energy stocks ( ) in Europe also recovered ground but remained in negative territory, down 0.4 percent.
The oil plunge underlined cracks in the global economy.
The German economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter as global trade disputes and problems in the auto industry threw the traditional export growth engine into reverse. Earlier in the day, data from Japan confirmed the world's third-largest economy contracted in the third quarter.
ITALIAN BUDGET WOES
Still in currency markets, the euro ( ) struggled below $1.13 as Italy re-submitted its draft budget for next year to the European Commission with the same growth and deficit assumptions that had been rejected by Brussels.
""While boosting its privatization plan and committing to mitigate spending overshoots, the Italian government did not change its deficit targets. This will likely lead the European Commission to recommend an infringement procedure,"" said Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts.
Concerns over the Italian budget also spread to debt markets with yields on Italian government bonds hitting three-week highs, widening the gap over top-rated German peers, while shares in Italian banks ( ) fell 1.3 percent.

153,2018-11-12,Dollar Carry Trade May Be Returning as Global Rates Diverge,"© Reuters. Dollar Carry Trade May Be Returning as Global Rates Diverge
(Bloomberg) -- Speculation that euro-area monetary officials will consider more stimulus for banks and expectations for further Federal Reserve tightening are causing spreads between U.S. and European debt yields to widen, adding to the case for euro weakness, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.
The gap on 2-year Treasury yields over their German counterparts this month surged to about 3.5 percentage points, a record. For Bilal Hafeez, Nomura’s global head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy, the size of the spread may be enough to spur a carry trade into the dollar.
Europe’s common currency was trading at $1.1242 as of 11:25 a.m. New York time, close to the weakest since June 2017. Hafeez did point to some silver linings for the euro. For one, he sees signals from the financial markets that the risks from Italy’s budget crisis may not spread to the rest of Europe. What’s more, the boost from U.S. fiscal stimulus appears set to wear off next year.
“The yield angle is therefore the most compelling to see further euro weakness,” Hafeez wrote in a note Monday. He added that the euro could settle into a range of $1.10-$1.135, which it stuck to for much of 2015 and 2016.
The outlook for the dollar carry trade, and thus for the euro-dollar rate, is clouded by the potential for a bout of risk aversion that causes the strategy to fall apart, Hafeez wrote. The dollar carry trade against the euro has returned 3.5 percent this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Equity weakness could lead to such a bout, which complicates the picture,” he wrote."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar built on last week's gains and rose toward a 16-month high on Monday as traders expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy, but sterling remained under heavy pressure amid uncertainty over a Brexit deal.
The Fed has reaffirmed its plan to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in December, followed by two more potential rate hikes by mid-2019 on the back of an upbeat economy and rising wage pressures.
The greenback has also benefited from a broader move away from riskier assets due to U.S.-Sino trade tensions, China's economic slowdown, Brexit uncertainty, and the standoff between Rome and the European Union over Italy's plan for a big-spending budget and wide fiscal deficit.
The ( ) against other major currencies edged up 0.1 percent on Monday to 97.02, just below its 16-month high of 97.2 hit on Oct. 31. The dollar index has strengthened four weeks in row, gaining 0.4 percent last week.
""The dollar index was firm all last week, bouncing back after the (U.S.) mid-term election results. Looking ahead, moves will be driven by the developments around the Italian budget and Brexit politics,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The dollar gained 0.1 percent on the Japanese yen which quoted at 113.98 on Monday, near a 6-week low of 114.08. The dollar has been preferred over the yen because of the diverging monetary policies of the Fed and the Bank of Japan.
While the Fed is on track to raise interest rates, the BOJ is expected to keep its monetary policy ultra-loose in the face of slow growth and inflation.
The widening interest rate differential between U.S. and Japanese bonds has made the dollar a more attractive bet than the yen, which is often used as a funding currency for carry trades.
The British pound lost 0.25 percent to $1.2941 amid increasingly fraught tensions within British Prime Minister Theresa May's government over whether she can produce an orderly exit plan from the European Union.
With less than five months before Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, negotiations are still stuck over a backup plan for the land border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, should they fail to clinch a long-term deal.
Four British ministers who back remaining in the European Union are on the verge of quitting Theresa May's government over Brexit, the Sunday Times reported, adding to the political uncertainty.
""Eventually, the EU and May will come to a deal. Both parties want to conclude the deal, but the only risk is whether May will still be prime minister. I expect sterling to remain choppy in its recent wide range,"" added Sim Moh Siong.
The euro ( ) traded at $1.1329 on Monday, down 0.05 percent. The single currency lost ground versus the dollar in the previous three trading sessions as investor confidence weakened due to the standoff over Italy's budget.
The European Commission rejected Italy's 2019 budget last month, saying it flouted a previous commitment to lower the country's deficit. The EU gave Rome until Tuesday to present a revised version of the budget.
The EU also cut its forecasts for Italian growth last week, adding to investor concerns over Italy's debts and economic outlook."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks were heading for their biggest drop in two weeks and emerging market currencies also slipped on Friday as a confident U.S. central bank and weak Chinese data hit demand for risky assets.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe ( ) fell half a percent, its biggest drop since Oct. 26, as the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates as expected but indicated that another rate increase is likely in December.
While the decision to hold rates was anticipated by markets, some participants had expected a more cautious approach from the central bank after a stock market rout in October.
But the Fed indicated a December increase is a distinct possibility in a robust economy. That contrasts sharply with China, where cooling producer price inflation and falling car sales suggested an economy struggling to gain traction.
""Worries about trade wars and how the slowdown in China will impact the rest of the world mean stocks appear to be more risky, so there's a typical risk-off move in markets today,"" said DZ Bank rates strategist Pascal Segesser.
Stocks in Hong Kong and China were the main losers in Asia, where a financial sector sub-index fell more than 2 percent after China's banking watchdog told lenders to allocate at least a third of new loans to private companies, raising the prospects of a jump in bad assets.
European stocks followed Asia lower, with main indexes opening in the red, though a batch of company earnings and UK GDP data might offer some support later in the session.
MSCI's main European index was down nearly 1 percent and the broader Euro STOXX 600 ( ) fell 0.7 percent.
A confident Fed also gave a boost to the dollar, which had weakened sharply after mid-term elections this week raised the prospects of U.S. political gridlock. The greenback gained a quarter of a percent against the euro ( ) and half a percent against the British pound.
The measuring the currency against its six major rivals ( ) gained 0.25 percent to 96.86.
Losses in equities pressured bond yields lower, with safe-haven benchmark debt in Germany and the United States softening across the board, pressured by world trade frictions and a budget standoff between Italy and Brussels.
Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand from of lower economic growth and trade disputes.
Benchmark Brent ( ) fell to its lowest since early April, down more than 18 percent since reaching four-year highs at the beginning of October.
The sturdy dollar tarnished the appetite for safe-haven gold , with the price down 0.2 percent at $1221.42 an ounce.
Still, market watchers said appetite for equities is likely to remain firm unless there is a big sell-off in credit markets or a spike in volatility.
An ETF ( ) tracking the performance of high-yield debt consolidated near three-week highs while gauges of volatility edged lower after a spike earlier this week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar gained versus the euro and sterling on Friday as the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady but reaffirmed its monetary tightening stance, setting the stage for a rate hike in December.
In foreign exchange markets, investor focus is now shifting back to the divergence between the monetary policies of the United States and other major economies, such as Japan where interest rates are seen staying extremely low. The yen, as a result, remains near a five-week low against the dollar.
The ( ), a gauge of its performance against six major peers, traded at a fresh one-week high at 96.75.
""The Fed looks set to raise rates in December. They have been largely unfazed by the equity market correction in October,"" said Ray Attrill, head of currency strategy at NAB.
Attrill added that the dollar strength also follows a weak euro and a jittery sterling over the last few trading sessions.
The Fed has raised its key policy rate three times this year, and the market expects another rate hike in December on the back of a robust U.S. economy, rising inflation and solid jobs growth.
According to the CME group's FedWatch tool, the likelihood of the Fed raising rates by another 25 basis points in December is 75 percent.
Analysts are also expecting more rate hikes by the Fed next year.
""We anticipate two more hikes in 2019: one in March and one in June,"" Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at HSBC, said in a note.
The yen reversed course after hitting a five-week low versus the dollar to trade at 111.86 on Friday.
The dollar has gained 2.24 percent versus the yen over the last 10 trading sessions due to the diverging monetary policies of the Fed and the Bank of Japan.
While the Fed is on track to raise interest rates, the BOJ is expected to keep its ultra loose monetary policy due to low growth and inflation.
The widening interest rate differential between U.S. and Japanese bonds has made the dollar a more attractive bet than the yen, which is often a funding currency for carry trades.
Meanwhile, the euro ( ) traded at $1.1342 on Friday, losing 0.18 percent versus the greenback. The single currency fell 0.54 percent on Thursday as traders reacted to negative news out of Europe.
The European Commission forecast on Thursday that the Italian economy would grow more slowly than Rome thinks in the next two years, leading to much bigger budget deficits than assumed by the new government.
The standoff between the EU and Rome over Italy's budget deficit and concerns over Europe's slowing economic growth have dragged the euro which has fallen 4.2 percent versus the dollar over the last six months.
The British pound changed hands at $1.3049 on Friday, trading marginally lower versus the dollar. Sterling has gained 2.3 percent against the dollar in November.
The pound has benefited from growing investor expectations that Britain is close to reaching a deal with the European Union, less than five months before it is due to exit the bloc."

By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is benefiting from a euro exchange rate that is too weak for its economy but too strong for others in the currency bloc, conservative Friedrich Merz, running to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of her party, said on Thursday.
The businessman, back from the political wilderness, has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Merkel as leader of their Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and secure the chance of running for chancellor - possibly even next year.
In unusually frank comments on currency policy from someone seeking a frontline political position, Merz said Germany had benefited greatly from the euro and as a result had a responsibility to ""contribute more"" to holding the EU together.
""Let's face it, we are benefiting from the monetary policy which most of the people in this country do not want. But we benefit from it, fundamentally,"" he told a panel discussion on Europe's Growth Challenge hosted by the Chatham House think tank.
""And this currency, which is in the meantime too weak for our economy, is still too strong for most of the others,"" he added, speaking English at the event in Berlin.
""We are benefiting within the European Union, within the internal market, but beside that we are benefiting in international trade - toward China, toward the U.S., toward other regions in the world - from this currency policy.""
Asked what he would do about the euro's ( ) exchange rate, Merz replied that Germany had a ""higher responsibility for European cooperation"" as a result of what he saw as its gains from the single European currency.
""We have to tell the people in this country that the Germans have to contribute more than others to the success of the European Union,"" he added, calling for close cooperation with France to find a way forward on European economic policy.
""We have to do more than we are actually doing because if Europe fails - and this is a clear option, no one can deny it, Europe is really at the threshold at the moment - if Europe fails, the Germans will be those who suffer most from that.""
BREXIT RISK
Merz, 62, was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Merkel in 2002 - a move that cemented her grip on the party on her way to becoming chancellor in 2005. Now, his bid for power - if successful - could precipitate her demise.
His chief rival in the race for the CDU leadership is the party's secretary general, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, who, as heir to Merkel's centrist cause, could probably cohabit as party leader with Merkel as chancellor, which she wants to remain until the end of the parliamentary term in 2021.
Such an arrangement would prove difficult with Merz, given his past rivalry with Merkel. The upshot could be early elections in 2019, especially as the Social Democrats are unsure whether they want to remain in Merkel's ruling coalition.
Merz, who is chairman of the German arm of the U.S. investment fund BlackRock (N: ), described Brexit as ""the biggest threat the European Union, at present, could be facing"".
""I do not hope that there will be another referendum in the UK to remain. I don't,"" he said. ""If it happened, you will leave back a greater minority who are still in favor for Brexit, and they will become even more radical anti-Europeans.""
""My personal view is that Brexit will happen,"" he added. ""Perhaps they (the British) will come back one day, 10 years after, but in the time being we have to have the best agreements we could have."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday after the European Commission cut its forecasts for Italian growth, adding to investor concerns about the euro-zone's third-largest member's debts and economic outlook.
While the euro dipped, the dollar extended its recovery following a sigh of relief across markets after the U.S. midterm election results, and as investors turned their attention towards the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Thursday.
The European Commission forecast the Italian economy would grow more slowly in the next two years than Rome thinks, making government budget deficits much higher than assumed by Italy, and supporting the Commission's view that Italy's 2019 draft budget breaks European Union fiscal rules.
The announcement sent the euro, which was up marginally on the day, into negative territory. It traded 0.2 percent lower at $1.1404 ( ) by 1135 GMT, at the day's lows.
""The Italian situation continues to pressure the euro,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX Strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ).
Tan said that adding to euro weakness was the dollar's rebound thanks to U.S. midterm election results that ""were in line with expectations and mean the Fed can go on its way"" in raising interest rates.
Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the vote while the Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate, resulting in a split U.S. Congress.

""That means that in particular positive wage, price and labor market data might provide support for the dollar.""
More broadly, analysts said foreign exchange traders were treading cautiously and looking for their next cue on the strength of the global economy, despite world stocks racking up their longest winning streak of 2018 on Thursday. The dollar gained 0.2 versus the Japanese yen to 113.72 . The dollar has gained over the past week versus the yen due to the diverging monetary policies of the U.S. Fed and the Bank of Japan.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks scaled a one-month peak on Thursday, after investors drove a Wall Street rally on relief the U.S. midterm elections delivered no major political surprises, while the dollar bounced and pulled away from 2-1/2-week lows.

Wall Street's main indexes rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday, led by the technology and healthcare sectors as the market breathed a sigh of relief after the U.S. midterm elections, in which Democrats wrested control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retained the Senate. ( )
""Going forward, we think the removal of uncertainty and realization of the expected outcome should be supportive for risk assets,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) analysts said in a report.
While a divided Congress will make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislation, such as additional tax cuts, investors do not expect a reversal of recently enacted tax cuts and deregulation.
""The key point after the midterm elections is that U.S. stocks showed they had developed immunity towards higher yields. The last time long-term Treasury yields were at this level a month ago, they had helped trigger a major fall by stocks,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Steady U.S. fundamentals will support this trend of equities and yields rising in tandem, which should also prop up the dollar in the longer term.""

That low for the greenback was driven by a knee-jerk reaction to the U.S. midterm election results, with a divided Congress seen dulling Trump's fiscal stimulus drive.
Some focus was also on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy due later on Thursday. The Fed, however, is not expected to hike interest rates until its next gathering in December and analysts expected this meeting to have limited market impact.
The central bank has tightened monetary policy three times in 2018, with the latest rate hike coming in September.
""A split Congress is unlikely to materially alter the Fed's near-term hiking trajectory and the Fed will be biased to keep raising rates until the data or financial conditions turn,"" strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) wrote.

By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged lower on Wednesday, with some investors tiptoeing back into riskier assets after midterm elections split power in the U.S. Congress, giving Democrats greater ability to check any major initiatives from President Donald Trump.
Traders pulled out of the safe-haven currency after the election results came in as expected. Some had worried that political instability might ensue if either party had won full control.
""There was this expectation that if we didn’t get a divided Congress, we might see risk sentiment becoming a little shaky, but since that didn’t happen we have a risk-on move,"" said Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities in New York.
The greenback has been the surprise winner in the global currency markets this year after Trump and congressional Republicans passed a significant tax cut, and strong economic growth prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to start steadily raising interest rates.
Market watchers believe the outcome of the U.S. midterm, with Democrats taking the House of Representatives and Republicans keeping control of the Senate, would make further tax cuts and deregulation unlikely for now.
""For the dollar, there are fewer fiscal initiatives like tax reform to drive sentiment higher. Any sort of fiscal stimulus is less likely to be observed over the next two years,"" said Issa.
Prospects of less fiscal stimulus would also relieve the pressure on the Fed to keep raising interest rates and add downward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar.
Some analysts had said a fully Republican Congress could have meant increased trade tension and a larger deficit.
Against a basket of other currencies ( ), the dollar slipped 0.16 percent on the day, last at 95.838, its lowest level in two weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 2.5 basis points, last at 3.189 percent.
Equity markets rallied as investors pushed funds into riskier assets, and on hopes that the reduced likelihood of more fiscal stimulus would bring the end to a multi-year U.S. rate hike cycle.
The euro ( ) gained half a percent to trade at $1.148. The single currency changed hands more than 1 percent above this year's trough of $1.1301 reached on Aug. 15."

Despite the split, Trump tweeted that the elections were a “tremendous success.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open on Wednesday and global stocks rose after significant U.S. election gains for the opposition Democrats, but the outcome may rule out further tax cuts, sending the dollar and Treasury yields sharply lower.
The Democrats look headed to gain more than 30 seats, well beyond the 23 they needed to claim their first majority in the House in eight years. With President Donald Trump's Republican party holding onto its Senate majority, the results from Tuesday's elections were in line with expectations.
Moreover, while gridlock in Washington could hamper Trump's political and economic agenda, few expect a reversal of tax cutting and financial deregulation measures that have already been enacted.
That view helped all three New York equity indexes to rise around 0.7 percent on Tuesday and they looked set to build on those gains, with S&P500 and Nasdaq futures up 0.7 percent and 1.25 percent respectively ( ) ( ).
Market sentiment had been volatile in Asian trade with stocks and the dollar swinging on the Republicans' fluctuating prospects of retaining the House. But by 0900 GMT, MSCI's world equity index was up 0.3 percent ( ), while a pan-European stocks benchmark jumped around one percent ( ).
""The good news in a way for markets is that there was an uncertainty that's now been removed. We know where we stand for the next two years and investors will focus back on the fundamentals which are (company) earnings growth and the economy,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.
On the other hand, most agree the newly empowered House Democrats will have the ability to investigate Trump's tax returns, possible business conflicts of interest and allegations involving his 2016 campaign's links to Russia.
Moreover, a split Congress will be able to hamper Trump's push for a further round of tax cuts and deregulation - measures that have turbo-charged the U.S. economy, stock markets and the dollar, keeping the Federal Reserve on a policy-tightening path.
The Fed is expected to signal this week that an interest rate rise remains on the agenda for December.
""Certainly it is now unlikely we will see additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term, that's a profound change but there will be no repeal of what's already in place,"" Miller said.
That view pushed the dollar 0.4 percent lower against a basket of currencies ( ). Against the yen, it was 0.4 percent lower at 113.06 , reversing earlier gains to a one-month high of 113.82 yen.
The euro rose almost half a percent to $1.148 ( ) a two-week high, while the British pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.315, clinging to three-week highs hit after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab indicated on Tuesday that a deal on exiting the European Union was likely.
On bond markets, ten-year U.S. Treasury bond yields fell below 3.18 percent, down four basis points on the day as it became clear that more fiscal stimulus was unlikely.
An initial knee-jerk rise to 3.25 percent came after early reports of a better-than-expected performance by the Republicans, but that move soon fizzled as results trickled in.
The bond market may remain under pressure from this week's record volumes of longer-dated government debt supply and the yawning Federal deficit. Many also reckon more spending increases are still possible.
""There are still areas with compromise for spending, so even with a split government I expect more fiscal stimulus ahead. There is some possibility for compromise on infrastructure spending as well,"" Steve Friedman, a senior economist at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management, said.
Attention will also focus on Trump's hard line on trade tariffs, which he can impose without Congressional approval. That keeps alive worries about a trade war between China and the United States.
Chinese shares closed 0.7 percent lower, while Hong Kong markets ended just above flat ( )
""We would argue that if Trump can do less on the domestic front he is more likely to focus on external matters such as trade, which will impact risk sentiment,"" said Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

The greenback has outperformed most of its key rivals so far this year thanks to the better-than-expected economic data and higher interest rates.
""If Congress is split, with the Democrats controlling the House and Republicans the Senate, the prospect of legislative gridlock that would make it difficult for policies such as the President's middle-class tax cut to pass is negative for the U.S. dollar,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management in a research note.

The dollar dipped against the euro ( ) and sterling , but made up ground on the Japanese yen as dealers kept their options open after the U.S. currency's bumper year so far.
""It is definitely not the time to buy the dip,"" said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner, referring to U.S. and globally-focused stock markets and risk assets.
""Everything that could go well for U.S. consumers in the last couple of years has gone well, but now the tide is turning... At the moment you are running out of drivers of growth in the U.S.""
Italian ( ) and Spanish ( ) stocks weakened as updated PMI figures confirmed euro zone business growth had fallen to a two-year low last month against the backdrop of trade tensions.
The future output index caused even more concern as it fell to a near four-year low of 60.5 from 62.1.
""Euro zone companies reported a disappointing start to the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiles the data.
Italian government bond yields were also pushing up after euro zone finance ministers called on Rome to change its budget at a meeting on Monday.
That had done little to ease the standoff between Italy and the European Union over the spending plan. With Rome not likely to bow to the demands any time soon it reignited concerns about a further escalation in the feud.
OIL SPILL
In Asian trading, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan ( ) edged up 0.4 percent following a positive finish for Wall Street on Monday.
Japan's Nikkei ( ) also climbed 1.1 percent though weaker Chinese markets and regional technology shares capped the region.
Apple (O: ) suppliers such as Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry (TW: ) were hit by a report that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report had also driven Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade.
While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump's pro-business agenda and raise concerns about U.S. political instability, some analysts say this may have already been priced in by investors.
The Cboe Skew index ( ), also known as the ""black swan"" index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid.
A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety.
""Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. ""So it's unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions.""
Gold was little changed but in oil markets crude prices were near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to continue buying oil from Iran temporarily, easing the likelihood of a sharp supply drop.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ( ) slipped 0.3 percent to $62.89 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday.
Brent crude futures ( ) dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday's 2-1/2-month low of $72.16.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stuck to tight ranges against its major rivals on Tuesday as investors favored caution ahead of U.S. midterm elections later in the day.
The U.S. congressional election is widely expected to boost the Democratic Party, which has a strong chance of winning control of the House of Representatives, with Republicans seen likely to keep the Senate.
""Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a victory for the Republicans - even in the House,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.
A Republican victory in both chambers was likely to boost the U.S. dollar, Yamamoto said. But a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields following the elections might lead to selling of U.S. equities.
""If there will be another big round of sell-offs in the U.S. equity market, then I think that's not necessarily positive for the dollar,"" he said.
The ( ), which measures the performance of the greenback against six key rivals, was basically flat at 96.319, moving in a range between 96.315 and 96.334. It hit a 16-month high of 97.20 last week.

Against the yen , the dollar changed hands 0.1 percent higher at 113.27 yen, close to a four-week high of 113.385 yen reached last week.
The Australian dollar held steady at $0.7211 as traders awaited a monetary policy decision from Australia's central bank due at 0330 GMT.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to extend its record spell of steady rates well into next year, according to a Reuters poll published on Monday.
All but one of the 39 analysts polled expected the RBA to hold rates at 1.50 percent at Tuesday's policy meeting, the poll found.
The pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.3063, trading just off a two-week high of $1.3070 hit earlier in the session after a media report suggested the E.U. and Britain may be inching closer to an orderly Brexit."

The services sector is critical component of the US economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).
The upbeat data was overshadowed by expectations that the U.S. mid-term elections Tuesday, will result in divided Congress, with Democrats tipped to take control of the House.
The midterms and the Federal Reserve policy action later in the week ""are significant enough in terms of event risk to keep investors sitting on their hands,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotia Capital.
A stronger pound also weighed on the dollar as analysts touted further room for upside in sterling following the Bank of England's hawkish remarks and the expansionary budget last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar paused after three consecutive weeks of gains as investors took profits before U.S. midterm elections this week that may fuel a bout of volatility for global markets, with the British pound leading gains on Brexit deal breakthrough hopes.
Notwithstanding a dollar selloff in the second half of last week, hedge funds added to their dollar holdings taking net long positions to its biggest levels since Dec. 2016 as latest data have encouraged more bullish bets.
But market analysts warn that an unexpected outcome at the midterm elections could trigger a massive unwind of long dollar positions and undermine the greenback which has rallied more than 7 percent from April lows against its rivals.
Tuesday’s U.S. congressional election is widely expected to help the Democratic Party, who have a strong chance of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives, with Republicans likely to keep the Senate.
""On the contrary, if the Republicans put up a strong showing, that could give President Trump a freer hand and he could step up his criticism of the Fed which may hurt the dollar,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, a senior analyst at ActivTrades Plc in London.

Friday's data showed that U.S. jobs growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pushing U.S. Treasury yields on ten-year maturities to 3.2 percent on Monday.
Broader moves in the currency markets were muted with only the British pound the big gainer as expectations grew that Britain and the European Union are inching closer to a deal.
The currency was lifted by a report over the weekend that said an all-UK customs deal will be written into the legally binding agreement governing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
EURO STRUGGLES
The strong U.S. data also brought into prominence the diverging trends between a robust U.S. economy and its struggling European counterpart with a Citibank economic monitor showing the European index near 2018 lows.
Recent dovish comments from senior policymakers such as Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn have raised some hopes that the European Central Bank could extend a new set of long-term loans to the bank sector.
Though ECB policymakers said last week that new targeted long-term refinancing operations are an option that may be considered in due time, sources have told Reuters that a new round of loans is not imminent.
The single currency ( ) softened 0.1 percent to $1.1378.
""The latest news heightens the downside risk to the euro from weaker economic data for a while,"" said John Marley at FX risk management specialist, Smart Currency Business.
Latest headlines from Italy were hardly conciliatory as eurozone finance ministers to meet later in the day with discussion of Italy’s budget high on their agenda.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the country’s budget deficit expansion could be a model for the rest of the EU to match U.S. fiscal stimuli and encourage investment growth.
Ulrich Leuchtmann, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE: ) said the latest comments from Italy suggest the government is not going to give in to the conflict with Brussels.
""There is a high risk of this conflict escalating,"" he said."

With the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, the prospect of even tighter U.S. monetary policy after strong economic data is also on investors' minds.
Markets are now pricing in a higher probability of a December rate hike with further tightening to 2.75-3.00 percent seen through 2019.
Tighter monetary policy, a stronger dollar, and trade tariffs have created what Citi strategists call ""Trump's triple tightening"" this year.
""This ...has slowed growth and raised risks around the world,"" they wrote.
Investors were also cautious ahead of the U.S. midterm elections.
Opinion polls show a strong chance the Democratic Party could win control of the House of Representatives after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with Trump's Republican Party likely to hold the Senate.
""What's spooking the market is not Congress or Senate - what's spooking the market is the volatility of Trump,"" said Perdon. ""I'm not convinced if there's a change of control that would be able to temper that.""

By Sujata Rao and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - A slump in the euro zone's biggest trading partners' currencies this year is blunting any boost that the euro's weakness versus the dollar could provide the region's exporters.
Two months before the European Central Bank is scheduled to begin winding up its crisis-era bond-buying program, the task is being complicated by signs that the bloc's economic momentum is running out of steam, and the euro is not helping.
While the single currency's 5 percent drop against the dollar ( ) in 2018 has captured the headlines, in ""effective"" terms it is roughly flat since January and close to four-year highs.
That is according to an ECB-compiled index that comprises the weighted average of the euro versus a basket of the bloc's 19 main trading partners.
GRAPHIC: Weights of trading partner countries in the euro's effective exchange rate - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OFFqai
Shifting trade patterns have diminished the dollar's role in the euro's trade-weighted basket to 17 percent from 22 percent in 2003.
By contrast, emerging currencies account for more than half, led by China's yuan on around 23 percent, up from sub-10 percent in 2003.
Hit by the United States's trade levies, the yuan has fallen across the board; against the euro it has lost 6 percent ( ) since June and around 1 percent since January.
That undermines the ECB's desire for a weaker euro to help stir stubbornly low inflation and support exporters at a time when slowing global growth momentum and trade tensions are dampening demand.

Many economists expect the ECB to lower its growth forecasts at its December policy meeting.
""What is under-appreciated is that there's been a massive break between euro trade-weighted and euro-dollar, and it's the former that really matters for the export sector,"" said Tim Graf, State Street (NYSE: ) Global Advisors' head of EMEA macro strategy.
""On that basis the euro is actually very strong because of Brexit, yuan depreciation and Turkey. The lira alone added 0.7 pct to the trade-weighted euro basket,"" Graf said, referring to the summer selloff that saw the lira hit record lows.
To be sure, a sturdy euro is not the main worry for ECB policymakers grappling with fading economic momentum and ructions in Italian bond markets.
Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies, said the euro was ""not something the ECB is going to lose sleep over"", arguing that a stronger currency may prove a bigger concern after quantitative easing ends.
But the euro's strength comes as worries about growth increase - euro zone economic expansion slowed in the third quarter, and third-biggest member Italy stagnated.
Negative economic surprises, according to Citi's barometer, have gathered steam.
While overall consumer price growth in the euro zone accelerated last month to 2.2 percent, the closely watched ""core"" inflation rate stood at 1.3 percent. The bank's inflation target is 2 percent.
A key gauge of markets' long-term inflation expectations is also near its lowest in a year.
Policymakers hope higher wages will fuel a rise in inflation soon.
ECB president Mario Draghi played down growth concerns last week, noting ""weaker momentum, not a downturn,"" and sticking to plans to exit stimulus at year-end.
""They don't have much wiggle room, because anything hawkish will strengthen the euro and they just won't want that with export growth starting to moderate,"" said State Street's Graf."

By Shrutee Sarkar
(Reuters) - Economic and political turbulence in the euro zone will keep the euro under pressure in coming months, but currency strategists in a Reuters poll still say it will rally next year once the U.S. dollar's dominance fades.
The challenge, say strategists, is trying to predict when the dollar - which is being driven higher by an economy outperforming its peers and a central bank set to deliver several more interest rate hikes - will lose its shine.
The euro ( ) is forecast to rise over 2 percent to $1.16 in three months. But over 80 percent of strategists who answered an extra question said the risk to those predictions were skewed more to the downside.
A shaky outlook for the single currency is being driven mostly by weaker growth for euro zone economies and lingering concerns about Italy's fiscal management in a stand-off with the European Commission over its borrowing.
The 12-month outlook for the euro has held steady at around $1.20 in Reuters polls throughout this year on expectations the European Central Bank will shut its quantitative easing (QE) program in December and raise interest rates in the second half of 2019.
But the U.S.-China trade war, which has already had a negative impact on economies across Asia, along with the not-insignificant risk of Britain leaving the European Union in five months without a deal has dented optimism.
The European Central Bank maintains it is on track to move away from super-stimulative policy toward something more restrictive. But that is being cast into doubt in markets, and along with it, conviction around how much the euro can rally.
""The near-term risks to euro zone growth have shifted to the downside – with both slower cyclical forces and political uncertainty both at play,"" noted Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING.
""Investors should focus on the interplay between short-term macro data releases and politics; if the former remains resilient in the face of the latter, then any EUR/USD downside will likely be short-lived.""
Reuters Poll: Risks to EUR/USD 3-month forecasts - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P4LNUK
After the euro hit a 13-month low of $1.1297 in August, respondents were asked in October how low the single currency would go in the current quarter. The median was $1.14, but the euro fell well below that last month and weakened to $1.1299, very close to the August low.
""The European economy is slowing and while the ECB remains on course to end QE this year and raise rates in 2019, the foundations of a euro rally are being taken away brick by brick,"" wrote Kit Juckes, global head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (PA: ), in a note to clients.
""We are in a $1.13-$1.18 range, the bottom of that range will be severely tested as growth slows, the Italian government sticks to its fiscal guns, and Brexit threatens to come off the rails.""
Still, the single currency, which has weakened nearly 6 percent in 2018 so far, was forecast to pare those losses and gain about 8 percent to $1.22 in a year from around $1.13 on Wednesday.
That euro year-ahead prediction is also driven by expectations the dollar's strong footing will end next year.
With several factors that have helped the dollar rally expected to fade soon, most major currencies are forecast to gain over the next 12 months, a view held by strategists in Reuters polls this year.
That comes after the greenback recorded a seventh consecutive month of gains in October and its biggest monthly rising streak since April 2015. (Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
Against a basket of rivals, the ( ) rose to 97.2 on Wednesday, its highest level since June 2017.
But the dollar index was forecast in the Oct 29-Nov 1 poll to fall to 92.5 by the end of next year.
While the U.S. economy is expected to continue to outperform its peers, a separate Reuters poll of economists taken last month showed economic growth will slow by the end of next year to half the latest reported rate of 4.2 percent. [ECILT/US]

Merkel has been chairwoman of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. Her decision to step down as chairwoman comes after her party suffered its second regional election setback in as many weeks.
The move also sets in motion the process for the CDU to settle on, and groom, Merkel's successor.
While German bonds, regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, often benefit from uncertainty, the implications of latest political developments left even German bond investors slightly rattled while the euro ( ) weakened.
""This news would signal the quality of German credit would deteriorate because markets are extrapolating from the results of the weekend state election to conclude that the next government will have a bigger populist portion to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell.
""So that explains the rise in German yields but there is also a need to treat German bonds as a risk-free (investment), so if there was a lot of stress a selloff would be limited.""
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose three basis points to 0.38 percent ( ), above seven-week lows hit last week at around 0.34 percent.
Across the German curve, yields were up 2-5 bps on the day.

The risk of the German coalition collapsing before the next election had risen, analysts said.
""Perhaps the biggest implications are for the euro zone as a whole,"" said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. ""Given her (Merkel's) weakened position, an agreement over Italy's budget may take longer to reach, increasing the threat of contagion to other markets and adding to the risks to Italian banks.""
S&P LIFT
For now, Italian bonds took their steer from news on Friday that ratings agency Standard & Poor's had decided to leave Italy's rating unchanged at BBB, two notches above junk.
S&P lowered the ratings outlook to negative from stable, saying that the new government's policy plans were weighing on the country's growth and debt prospects.
But the decision to leave the rating unchanged, a week after Moody's downgraded its Italy rating, bought some relief.
Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to its lowest in almost a month at 3.29 percent ( ), before settling at around 3.32 percent by the close.
The gap over top-rated German bond yields narrowed to 294 bps from around 306 bps late Friday ( ).
""The underlying budget concern is an ongoing issue but the ratings risks are out of the way for the rest of the year as there are no more scheduled ratings decisions,"" said Commerzbank (DE: ) rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a 10-week high on Friday as investors waited to see if U.S. economic growth figures do anything to interrupt its months of strength.
Donald Trump has expressed displeasure over the dollar's strength, defying a custom that U.S. presidents avoid openly interfering in financial markets.
Traders expect a potentially strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product data on Friday which could see the dollar climb further.
""Today's robust U.S. GDP will illustrate to the market the deep division between the U.S. and the euro zone when it comes to growth performance,"" said Commerzbank (DE: ) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen.
Speculation that U.S. interest rates will be hiked more aggressively than anticipated next year would see the dollar strengthen against the euro, she added.
If the reading is lower than expectations, however, investors could worry about economic growth momentum hastening a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening path.
""This number could give signs if we are close to peak earnings for U.S. corporates. Housing data and consumer goods durables data has been soft lately,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The U.S. economy is expected to have grown at a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, following 4.2 percent in the second quarter. The Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in December.
The euro, meanwhile, ( ) traded marginally higher at $1.1383 on Friday. It hit a two-month low of $1.1353 the previous session, following European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's failure to convince traders the ECB could pursue monetary tightening after next summer as political and economic uncertainties grow in the monetary union.
The policy guidance has been consistent since June, even though the economic outlook has darkened as political turmoil about Italy looms over the currency bloc.
Analysts said markets remain skeptical about the ECB rates given inflation remains tepid.
Elsewhere, a rebound of U.S. stocks on Thursday following the previous session's big sell-off was not sustained into the Asian day, which lent support to safe haven currencies.
The U.S. dollar lost 0.2 percent to be 112.14 versus the Japanese yen , a safe haven currency, while the Australian dollar , often viewed as a gauge of risk appetite, hit a near 33-month low.
The ( ) traded flat at 96.56 on Friday, after hitting a two-month high on Thursday. The gains in the dollar index were largely due to the losses in the euro, which has a 57.6 percent weighting in the index.
The dollar has been supported by positive sentiment on Wall Street recently as blue-chip names such as Microsoft (O: ) delivered strong earnings.
Analysts see many persisting risks for markets, including trade tensions, Italy's budget woes, geopolitical uncertainties and concerns about U.S. corporate earnings.
""Is there a slowdown coming at the moment? That's the question, and the combination of all these factors is dragging down sentiment,"" said Miraji Othman, credit strategist at BayernLB.

""The markets have been acting like classic flight-to-safety markets,"" said London & Capital's head of fixed income Sanjay Joshi, pointing to the slump in stocks and rally in safer bonds and currencies.
""The worst thing the ECB could do would be to come out with a hawkish statement considering the situation we have at the moment.""
Most economists expect ECB President Mario Draghi to say the bank will stick to plans to end stimulus this year. But it will be the signal he sends about market volatility and concerns around Italy, his homeland, that could be most crucial.

Europe's stabilization was aided by results from Swiss bank UBS and engineering giant ABB (S: ) which helped take the edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning from U.S. digger behemoth Caterpillar (N: ).
The ECB was looming too. Weak euro zone economic data this week have added to angst over world growth, as has a surprise slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing.
It wasn't just the ECB that was being closely watched either. Turkey, which has been stabilizing in recent weeks having been at the center of emerging market troubles was also holding a central bank meeting.

The got an initial boost before fading after its biggest component by weighting, Boeing (NYSE: ) Co., rallied on a positive profit forecast. Shares of home builders slumped after new home sales fell more than expected, showing that the consequences of higher interest rates are trickling down to the consumer.
“There’s just right now a heightened sensitivity to what can go wrong,” Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward D. Jones & Co., said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “So we will have more of these days where stocks move a lot within the day as everyone’s trying to sort through what do today’s reports mean.”
The pound weakened on Brexit worries, and European bonds followed Treasuries higher. The euro dropped following disappointing manufacturing data.
Sentiment remains fragile as global shares chart a course for the worst month in more than three years. The cautious mood was further damped by renewed worries over the impact of tariffs after industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ). warned about rising costs due to higher steel prices. European politics is also in focus, with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte doubling down on his government’s budget and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet descending into conflict.
Retailers were the biggest winners in the Index. A turnaround in China’s markets helped the MSCI Asia Pacific Index avoid a bear market even as it edged down.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The safe-haven Japanese yen and the Swiss franc held firm against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as risk-averse investors trimmed their exposure to the greenback in the face of a weak performance on Wall Street.
Worries about U.S. corporate earnings knocked the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) and the S&P 500 ( ) on Tuesday, though they had pared losses by the closing bell.
While the dollar is also considered a safe haven currency, weakness in U.S. equities has tended to undercut its appeal especially as talk of a peak in U.S. corporate earnings has raised concerns about the outlook for economic growth.
Any signs of strain in U.S. growth has implications for Federal Reserve policy, with a steady pace of U.S. rate increases providing a boost to the dollar this year.
""We have maintained that when sentiment really turns nasty that the yen will remain the market’s safe haven of choice,"" said Rabobank analysts in a research note.
The Japanese yen was steady at 112.43 in early Asian trade, having gained 0.32 percent on Tuesday and was the best performing currency in the G-10 space in that session.
The , a gauge of its value against six major peers, was wobbly in early Asia trade. It was last slightly lower at 95.94.
The Swiss franc , considered another safe haven, traded flat at 0.9952 on the dollar, after advancing over the last two sessions.
The euro ( ) was also steady at $1.1472, although bearish sentiment against the common currency amid Italy's budget woes has limited any chance of a rally.
On Tuesday, the European Commission rejected Italy's draft 2019 budget, saying it brazenly broke EU rules on public spending, and asked Rome to submit a new one within three weeks or face disciplinary action.
The uncertainty around Italy's free spending budget has also bred some doubt on whether the European Central Bank (ECB) would be able to raise interest rates next summer.
""Euro will move cautiously for the next 3 weeks as it looks like Italy doesn't want to give ground,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at NAB.
""However, in the near term we don't think Italy's woes will affect ECB's policy...ECB will try to paint a picture of confidence in the short term,"" Catril said.
The British pound is likely to remain in focus as British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to address her Conservative Party lawmakers at a private meeting in parliament later today, as she seeks to calm growing tensions over her Brexit strategy.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell toward a two-month low on Tuesday before a meeting by the European Commission on Italy's budget that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of rejecting it and demanding changes.
A dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the leadership of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the likelihood of further political turmoil in Europe.
That contributed to broad risk aversion on Tuesday, with the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell.
Worries about Italy's spending has bred some doubt about the European Central Bank's plan to raise interest rates next summer and that has hurt the euro. On Tuesday, it fell 0.2 percent to $1.4390, nearing a two-month low of $1.4325 hit on Oct. 9. ( )
Italy's bond yields ticked up on Tuesday before the meeting. Mario Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said on Monday he was confident an agreement could be reached.
""The prospect of a normalization of monetary policy was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now going to crumble,"" Commerzbank (DE: ) analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said.
Tensions are likely to heighten between Rome and Brussels, especially if the European Council launch an ""Excessive Deficit Procedure"" against Italy, said Philip Wee, currency strategist at DBS in a note.
""This would require Italy to provide a plan of corrective action to rein in its large public debt, currently at 130 percent of GDP vs the 60 percent Maastricht rule,"" Wee said.
The ( ), a gauge of its value against six other major currencies, rose to a two-month high of 96.158 and traded up 0.1 percent.
That was due to the turbulence in Europe continent and expectations that a strong U.S. economy may see the Federal Reserve raise rates faster than assumed.
Britain's pound traded up 0.2 percent at $1.3 after falling on Monday on fears that the Irish border issue and disagreements within Britain's ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge.
""Whispers of a growing number of Tory MP rebels losing their patience with May have put the risks of a lengthy UK political impasse and a Brexit policy mistake (exiting the EU without a deal) back on the table,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING.
""We think this noise is likely to keep the pound on the back foot this week,"" he said.

By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday as a fall in Italian government borrowing costs after their recent surge introduced some calm into the market, while the promise of more Chinese stimulus helped offset broader political worries.
Rating agency Moody's downgraded the Italian government's credit rating on Friday but unexpectedly kept the outlook at stable.
That, together with comments by Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio that the government was ready to sit down with the European Union amid the ongoing row over Rome's budget, boosted demand for Italian debt after a sharp selloff in recent weeks.
The euro has often fallen this year when Italian government bond yields have spiked higher.
The single currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.1550 ( ), hitting the day's high and away from recent lows of $1.1433.
The dropped 0.3 percent to 95.472 ( ).
The euro was also 0.2 percent higher at 1.1487 Swiss francs ( ), and gained 0.2 percent versus sterling to 88.26 pence ( ).
Despite the euro's rally, analysts said it remained at the mercy of Italian developments, with a great deal of uncertainty ahead.
""...A full diary of risk events over the next two weeks and little to argue in favor of support from the ECB (European Central Bank) in the near future, the question remains over how far the yield gap can blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
Equity markets were largely in positive territory as hopes that China's tax cuts next year could be worth more than one percent of gross domestic product sparked a rally in Asian shares that fed across to Europe.
That helped offset geopolitical concerns about the rift between Saudi Arabia and the West over the killing of a prominent critic of the kingdom, as well as worries about Britain securing an exit deal with the EU.
Forex markets were largely quiet, although the more positive tone at the start of the week did buoy sentiment.
For the dollar, a hawkish Federal Reserve and signs of continued strength in the U.S. economy remain key drivers.
""Markets will be closely watching the release of the U.S. advance GDP number on Friday for more clarity on the direction of the U.S. dollar,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
The dollar rose versus the Japanese yen . The yen fetched 112.71, down 0.2 percent on the day and off a one-month high of 111.61 touched on Oct. 15.
The yen had benefited from rising risk around Brexit, the Italy budget plan and trade tensions, because investors tend to buy the Japanese currency when they are nervous.
The Canadian dollar changed hands at 1.3080 on its U.S. counterpart, within striking distance of a five-week low of 1.3132 hit on Friday on the back of weaker inflation and retail sales.

(Bloomberg) -- The could revisit its year-to-date low as persistent political risks may lead to refrain from painting a rosier picture for the bloc’s economy.
Market dynamics have shifted only slightly since the European Central Bank’s last meeting, yet not in a supportive way for the common currency. Data may be suggesting the forecasts for growth are broadly on track with the Governing Council’s projections, but on the other hand subdued inflation, early signs of contagion in peripheral bonds, deadlocked Brexit negotiations and a hawkish Federal Reserve could mean the euro could test its $1.1301 mid-August low.
Draghi said he sees a “relatively vigorous” pickup in underlying euro-area inflation following the September monetary policy decision and while wage pressure is building, the pass-through to prices is yet to be seen. At a time when the market looks behind the curve when it comes to additional U.S. tightening, there may be little room for the ECB president to downplay monetary policy divergence projections at the next gathering on Oct. 25.
Price action in the spot market this month showed that the euro could benefit from a Brexit resolution. U.K. and EU officials keep kicking the can down the road however as obstacles remain, with focus now turning to a December EU summit, as volatility shows. European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker present conclusions from the Oct. 18-19 summit to the EU Parliament next week, with the bar high for a positive surprise.
For the short-term, investors are looking closely at the performance of euro-area peripheral bonds as the rift between Italy and the EU widens. Italy’s over Germany touched the highest in more than five years following a letter from the European Commission to Rome that said its spending plans were excessive. While resilience was the name of the game initially, led the widening versus bunds on Thursday and the rose by 8 basis points Friday to 2.11 percent, highest since May.
The euro flirted with a two-month low Friday, hitting $1.1433, just one pip higher than its mid-August trough. Bloomberg’s fear-greed indicator shows bears are in firm control of price action, while a crossover in short-term moving averages suggests the latest rally for the dollar has legs to follow. On the weekly chart, a close below $1.1457 opens the room for a test of the $1.1300 handle.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-week low against the dollar on Friday as the European Commission's criticism of Italy's populist budget sparked fresh concerns about political tensions in the common currency zone.
The ( ), a gauge of its value against major peers, was 0.05 percent higher at 95.96 on Friday, having closed on Thursday at its highest level since Aug. 21. That rise was driven by a steep fall in the euro on Thursday, which constitutes around 57 percent of the index.
The euro ( ) was relatively flat at $1.1454 on Friday, steadying slightly after losing 0.4 percent overnight. The single currency hit its lowest intra-day level of 1.1447 since Oct. 9 on Thursday after the European Commission said Italy's 2019 budget draft is in serious breach of European Union budget rules.
The Commission said in a letter to Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, that planned government spending was too high, the structural deficit - excluding one-offs and business cycle effects - would rise instead, not fall, and that Italian public debt would not come down in line with EU rules.
This has sparked investor concerns about more political tensions in the EU between Brussels and member states, which has hurt the euro.
The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yield spreads hit its widest level in 5-1/2 years after news of the Commission letter broke.
Italy's prime minister defended the nation's free spending budget, though markets were not impressed.
""The euro decline reflects the build up of political tension in the eurozone,"" said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore.
""The next support for the euro is at 1.1430, a break of which can take us down to 1.13.""
The British pound hit a fresh 11-day low on Friday, but rebounded slightly to quote at $1.3020 versus the dollar.
Traders placed bearish bets on the sterling as a EU-UK summit failed to yield a decision on Britain's exit from the euro zone.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, on Thursday said that the European Union's proposal on the Irish border was unacceptable.
""Unless we get positive noises from Brussels, the impasse on Brexit and softer economic data suggests that the pound could underperform,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of currency strategy in a note.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.17 percent versus the dollar on Friday, to trade at 112.31.
The greenback lost 0.4 percent of its value to the yen on Thursday, reflecting the global risk-off mood due to rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, Italy's budget woes and U.S-Sino trade war tensions.
Wall street benchmark equity indices also tumbled more than 1.2 percent each, with technology stocks leading the pack.
China's economic growth in the third quarter slowed to 6.5 percent, its weakest pace since 2009 and below expectations, as a campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States weighed on the economy.
The yuan changed hands at 6.9339 on Friday, trading flat versus the dollar, after recovering from its intra-day low of 6.9416.
""Expectations have increased for the Chinese yuan to depreciate towards its psychological 7 level against the USD,"" said Eugene Leow, rates strategist at DBS in a note."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar crept up on Friday, reflecting investor confidence in the U.S. economy, despite criticism by President Donald Trump of the Federal Reserve and a sell-off in U.S. equities.
The decline in stocks has yet to spread into foreign exchange markets, with emerging market currencies still appreciating and the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc not budging significantly.
Concern about a trade war between the United States and China and expectations interest rates will rise further in coming months have underpinned the dollar's 2.5 percent rise since July.
But a drop in U.S. Treasury bond yields and weaker-than-forecast rise in U.S. consumer prices saw the dollar shed half a percent on Thursday as traders cut their bets on Federal Reserve rate hikes.
Hedge fund have staked out their longest dollar positions since the end of 2016 and markets are focused on any tweak in data that could alter the Fed's thinking.
The ( ), a gauge of its value against six major currencies, traded flat at 95 on Friday, down from its monthly high of 96.15 on Tuesday.
""We doubt the dollar will derive much further cyclical support through the remainder of the year. Political uncertainty could also undermine the dollar ahead of the mid-term elections on 6 November,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of Global Markets Research at MUFG.
""The longer-term negative structural implications of the growing U.S. twin deficits will increasingly weigh on U.S. dollar sentiment,"" he added.
Other analysts see few signs the dollar will fall further. Fed officials said last month they expected three rate hikes in 2019.
""If the equity markets were to calm down again quickly without developments spreading to other asset markets, there is no reason in our mind why the Fed should not continue its rate hikes as planned,"" said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE: ) in Frankfurt.
""The dollar will be able to maintain its current strong levels for now but further appreciation potential is limited,"" she said.
The euro ( ) was the main beneficiary of dollar weakness on Friday, reaching a weekly high at 1.1611 after minutes of the last European Central Bank meeting set a positive tone.
The minutes suggested the ECB was on track to normalize its ultra-loose monetary policy this year despite concern about slowing growth in Europe.
""We've heard quite a bit of comment from euro zone policymakers recently about rising inflation and the message is consistent, which is that price pressures are growing,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management.
The Japanese yen , a preferred currency in times of market turbulence, traded at 112.34 on Friday. It had strengthened to 111.83 versus the dollar on Thursday, its highest since Sept. 18.
The Australian dollar was at $0.7122, recovering from Monday's two-year low of $0.7039. The rally was aided by promising news out of China, its biggest trade partner."

The greenback was also kept in check by a stronger euro, though analysts warned the single currency has limited room for upside amid contagion risks from Italy.
The Italian Senate approved the motion to push back the balanced budget from 2020 to beyond 2021 after it introduced a higher-than-expected budget deficit target at 2.4%, raising the risk of backlash from Brussels.

""There seems to be a disconnect and there is no obvious explanation for why the dollar did not fare better on a risk-off day,"" said Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at NAB.
"" The yen continues to show its colors as the markets favorite risk haven proxy,"" added Attrill.
The safe-haven yen strengthened to 112.13 against the dollar, its highest level this month, taking heart from risk aversion in the wake of warnings from the IMF over global growth and financial stability.
""There was a clear bid for current-account surplus countries with both the JPY and EUR finding support,"" ANZ said in a note.
the U.S. Federal Reserve's apparent determination to raise interest rates over the next 12 months has driven up U.S. Treasury yields, which have been further bolstered by strong economic data.
""We expect rising inflation to keep the Fed hiking interest rates at its current once-a-quarter pace until the middle of 2019,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Expectations of hawkish rate rises may have been at work on Wednesday when sellers sent the Nasdaq ( ) to close at 7044.49, its lowest level since early July.

EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday the parties had agreed on much of the withdrawal agreement ahead of a summit of the bloc's 28 national leaders next week.
But the euro's gains are likely to be limited with markets worried about the sustainability of Italy's public finances, despite Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria stating that the government would do everything in its power to regain the confidence of financial markets.
Sterling traded at $1.3228, its highest in a week, as investors bet on an orderly British departure from the EU in March.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro languished near a seven-week low on Tuesday as concerns about a row in the European Union over Italy's budget persisted.
The euro has tended not to budge in response to spikes in Italian bond yields triggered by developments in the dispute, with investors judging that Rome's spending plans will not impact the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
But the threat of a showdown along with weakness in stock markets worldwide has seen traders who had bet on a fourth quarter euro rebound ditch the single currency.
The euro ( ) fell 0.2 percent to $1.1465, close to a seven-week low of $1.146 reached during the previous session.
Italian government bond yields meanwhile edged down from 4-1/2-year highs on hopes that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria will strike a moderate tone when defending the government's budget in parliament.
""In light of current levels of stress in the Italian markets, the question now is how far the Bund/BTP yield gaps can blow out and how this could translate back into the FX market,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.
Italy's Deputy Prime Minister on Monday denounced European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici as enemies of Europe.
Derrick said increasingly it was the dollar rather than the Swiss franc that was benefiting from safe-haven trades in response to the concerns over Italy.
Against the Swiss franc ( ), the euro gained 0.1 percent to 1.1414 ( ).
Ten-year Treasury yields resumed their steep climb to seven-year highs on Tuesday. That helped the dollar strengthen across the board with only Japan's yen outperforming among the major currencies.

The dollar stretched an overnight rally to touch 114.55 yen , its highest since early November 2017. It last stood at 114.345. A rise above 114.735 yen would take the U.S. currency to its highest level since mid-March 2017.

By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The euro will withstand the latest political turmoil in Italy and any short-term spill will be limited, but it may be another six months before the dominant dollar trade is swept aside, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists.
After its best run since 2003 last year, the single currency is down close to 4 percent so far in 2018, driven mainly by increasing bets in favor of the dollar on solid U.S. economic performance and the Federal Reserve's policy tightening path.
Markets recently have been unnerved by the uncertainty surrounding Italy's debt pile, fiscal plans and future ties with Europe, which pushed the single currency to a six-week low of $1.1504 against the dollar on Tuesday.
But the latest poll of over 70 strategists taken Sept 28-Oct 3 forecast the euro ( ) to trade higher at $1.16 in three months from around $1.15 on Wednesday. It was then expected to rise to $1.22 in a year, about a six percent rise from here.
""We feel that a lot of bad news is already priced into Italian assets - including a Moody's downgrade - and hence see the balance of risks tilted toward the euro moving higher from here as some of the markets' worst fears are shelved,"" noted Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.
The single currency is expected to fall at most by only one percent to a low of $1.14 at some point over the next three months, according to the median of 30 strategists who answered an additional question. But that would still be comfortably above a 13-month low of $1.1297 hit in August.
""For the euro to move well below $1.1500 and back down toward the previous lows...we would really need to see the Italian debt situation escalate significantly from here and challenge the sustainability of the euro zone and euro going forward,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG.
""That is not our base case scenario. But obviously if we reach that kind of a crisis scenario, all bets are off, because it will be going a lot lower.""
LESS BACKING FOR GREENBACK IN 2019
While currency speculators increased their bets in favor of the dollar for the second week in a row, strategists in the latest Reuters poll were almost evenly split on whether the greenback's rally has already stalled.
A majority of strategists who answered a separate question said the U.S. dollar's dominance will last only another three months or six most.
With several of the factors that have helped the dollar rally expected to fade soon, most major currencies are forecast to gain in a year.

""It might run up a little bit further for a couple of months on the emerging markets side, but the dollar versus major currencies is starting to peak,"" said Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at NAB.
""Markets are getting more interested in the end of the U.S. (tightening) cycle, which has been almost fully priced in.""
Against the dollar, sterling was forecast to strengthen by the time Britain leaves the European Union. But over the coming year it was not expected to regain its losses since the shock Brexit vote in 2016. [GBP/POLL]
""Our basic assumption is that we think the EU and the UK will eventually reach a Brexit deal. At this stage, it is still highly uncertain how they get to that kind of end-point of a deal. The pound could yet weaken further before a deal is reached,"" added Hardman.
""But we still think that overall, a deal is more likely as both sides want to avoid a no-deal scenario. That should result in the pound strengthening notably.""

U.S. employers added 230,000 jobs in September, well above economists' expectations, a report by payrolls processor ADP showed on Thursday.
Economists had expected the ADP nonfarm payrolls report to show a gain of 187,000 jobs.

Elsewhere, the euro was lower despite news that Italy’s government will reduce its budget deficit targets for 2020 and 2021 to 2.2% and 2% respectively and stick with its plan for 2.4% for 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar stood near a one-month high against its peers on Wednesday as concerns as political wrangling over Italy's budget plan rattled market sentiment and weighed on the euro.
The greenback rose as the euro slumped after a senior Italian lawmaker said most of the country's problems would be solved if it returned to a national currency of its own.
The euro was little changed at $1.1550 ( ) in Asian trade after retreating to a six-week low of $1.1505 overnight.
The Italian lawmaker, Claudio Borghi, later back-pedalled on his comments. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also said the euro was ""unrenouncable.""
Still, that was not enough to prompt a strong bounce for the euro, which has been stung recently by worries over heavily indebted Italy's budget situation.

The yen, another safe-haven currency, also gained against peers such as the euro, dollar and Australian dollar.
The greenback last stood at 113.62 yen , having pulled back from an 11-month high of 114.06 reached on Monday.
""The slip by European currencies in the wake of the latest Italian concerns has lifted the dollar. But a larger component of the dollar's recent rise comes from fundamental factors fortified after the Fed's rate hike,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The dollar index has advanced about 1.4 percent since last Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and said it foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year and one in 2020.
""U.S. data due later today such as the non-manufacturing ISM index and Friday's jobs report will provide a chance to see if the economy is performing in line with the Fed's views,"" Ishikawa said.
The pound was little changed at $1.2981 after dropping on Tuesday to $1.2941, its weakest since Sept. 10, as conflicts over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan escalated.
The Australian dollar was steady at $0.7189 after sliding the previous day to a two-week trough of $0.7162. The , sensitive to shifts in global risk sentiment, was hit as equities sold off on worries over Italy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's 10-year bond yield soared to a 4-1/2 year high on Tuesday after an Italian lawmaker said that most of the country's problems would be solved by ditching the euro, deepening market concerns over its public finances.
The comments by Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League party, pushed the spread ( ) ( ) between Italian and German yields to the widest in more than five years, briefly hitting 302 basis points and as euro zone officials warned of a return to crisis days, the Italian/Spanish yield gap was at its widest over any closing price in the last 20 years.
The reference to the possibility of Italy leaving the euro jolted a market already shaken by a budget proposal last week that put Rome on a collision course with Brussels.
Borghi on Tuesday clarified that the government had no intention of leaving the euro and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy is totally committed to the currency.
This bought some calm to bond markets, with Italian yields pulling away from their highs, but borrowing costs remained elevated as concerns about the fallout from Italy's 2019 budget plans lingered.
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio reiterated Italy would not change its budget deficit targets.
""Fundamentally, investors know Italy's government is not going to turn on its commitments, so you are still going to have a fiscal policy that is inappropriate, given Italy's debt metrics,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
Italy's 10-year government bond yield ( ) hit a 4-1/2 year high of 3.44 percent, before pulling back to 3.36 percent -- still up 7 basis points on the day.
Italy's two-year bond yield was up 5 bps at 1.42 percent and five-year yields briefly jumped 21 bps to 2.77 percent, both hitting their highest in about four months. ( ) ( )
Trading volume in two-year BTP futures in the last two days is the heaviest since May .
""In this environment when everyone is nervous, these comments just add to the risk-off sentiment,"" said Commerzbank (DE: ) strategist Christoph Rieger. ""It smells clearly like the crisis days,"" he added, referring to the euro zone debt crisis of 2010-2012, when the breakup of the bloc was a possibility.
Rieger said market sentiment was also hit by comments from the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker comparing Italy with Greece.
ITALIAN BANKS, EURO HIT
The euro fell to a six-week low at $1.1505 ( ) after Borghi's comment and shares in Italian banks ( ), whose government bond holdings make them sensitive to political developments, fell as much as 3.9 percent to their lowest in 19 months on fears a bond sell-off would cut their capital ratios, raise their funding costs and hamper efforts to cut bad loans.
The bank index was down 0.8 percent, with shares in Italy's largest lenders Intesa Sanpaolo (MI: ) and UniCredit (MI: ) both falling more than 2.5 to multi-month lows.
The cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign debt and the debt of the country's largest lenders also rose sharply.
The Italian government is to finalize the 2019-2021 budget program later on Tuesday, Di Maio said.
""Neither the EU or Italy is incentivized to compromise it seems, at least in the opening gambit of the talks,"" said Patrick O'Donnell, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.
He said Italy's 10-year borrowing costs could reach 4 percent by the end of the year.
Outside Italy, euro zone bond yields fell as investors retreated to the safety of better-rated borrowers such as Germany, Netherlands and Austria.
Germany's 10-year bond yield slipped three bps to 0.44 percent ( ), while Spanish and Portuguese bond yields ( ) ( ) were little changed - showing no signs of contagion from the Italy bond sell off."

(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s most important move Wednesday might have been the bump up in its longer-term projection for the policy interest rate -- and that’s bound to help the dollar, according to NatWest Markets.
“We expect the dollar to keep benefiting from rising carry returns, with the euro and yen still at risk of making new one-year lows through $1.13 and 115 respectively over the next few months,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, the head of foreign-exchange strategy at NatWest in Singapore, wrote in a note.

In the early days of the rate-hiking cycle that began in 2015, U.S. central bankers were lowering their longer-term expectations for the policy rate, and that countered the otherwise positive impact of monetary tightening on the dollar, Mohi-uddin said. They stopped lowering the forecast this year, allowing Fed hikes to support the greenback, the argument goes.
Fed officials have boosted their median estimate for the longer-term federal funds rate to 3 percent, from 2.875 percent in June. The Fed also bumped its current target range for the rate by a quarter point, to 2 percent to 2.25 percent Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher on Wednesday in choppy trading after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected for the eighth time, flagged more rate hikes and signaled the end of the ""accommodative"" policy era.
The greenback briefly fell against the euro and yen after the release of the Fed statement but slowly inched higher as market participants digested the statement.
Fed policymakers lifted the benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent. The central bank also removed from its policy statement a description of monetary policy as remaining accommodative.
""Today's dropping of keyword 'accommodative' from its policy statement ensures the Fed remains on course for further hikes as unemployment heads towards multi decade lows,"" said Robert Sierra, director at Fitch Ratings.
""The Fed continues to be very much focused on strong domestic conditions and neither trade concerns nor recent emerging market turbulence affected today's decision,"" he added.
For Mark McCormick (NYSE: ), head of North American FX strategy, at TD Securities in Toronto, however, the removal of the word ""accommodative"" is a dovish signal and was the reason for the initial fall in the dollar.
""To me, it means that the Fed is more or less in a neutral stance and is probably close to being done raising rates,"" McCormick said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell clarified that the removal of ""accommodative"" in the statement is a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with expectations.
In afternoon trading, the ( ), which measures the U.S. unit against six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 94.179 ( )

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to more than a three-month high against the dollar on Monday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said he sees a vigorous pickup in euro zone inflation, backing moves toward unwinding an ECB asset purchase program meant to stimulate the economy.
The single currency has been on an uptrend the last few weeks, bolstered by generally solid European economic data. Over the last 10 days, the euro has risen 2.5 percent versus the greenback.
The dollar, meanwhile, was little changed to slightly higher against the yen, as investors searched for fresh clues to extend a multi-month rally in the greenback before a widely-expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve this week.
The dollar briefly dipped against the yen after some media said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was headed to the White House amid reports he had offered to resign in anticipation of being fired by President Donald Trump.
Other media, however, reported that Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, had not offered to resign.
With the Fed decision a few days away, markets were jolted by Draghi's hawkish comments on inflation and wage growth even though he affirmed the ECB's pledge to keep rates at their current, rock-bottom level ""through the summer"" of next year.
John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington, said Draghi's remarks reinforced the view that other central banks are catching up with the Fed in terms of tightening monetary policy.
""The idea of divergence between the Fed tightening and other central banks either on hold or cutting rates is not there to support the dollar anymore,"" Doyle said.
In midday trading, the euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.1771 ( ). It rose to as high as $1.1815, a 3-1/2-month peak.
The euro earlier was also boosted after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government resolved a dispute over the country's scandal-tainted spy chief on Sunday, ending a threat to the six-month-old administration.
Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.1 percent at 112.65 yen ahead of this week's Fed meeting.
With the market forecasting a rate hike this week, another in December and two more next year - roughly in line with Fed policymakers' projections - analysts said only unexpectedly strong data would change those bets.
""Dollar direction could boil down to how many rate hikes the Fed pencils in over the coming year,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
""The Fed could increase its forecast for 2019 rate hikes from three to four with inflation showing signs of pushing above its 2 percent goal, a hawkish scenario that would likely be positive for the dollar,"" he added.
Earlier the dollar snapped a two-week losing streak as the weekend brought global trade tensions back into the spotlight after Beijing released a white paper on its trade dispute with the United States, saying it would seek a reasonable outcome, while also describing U.S. tactics as ""bullying.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from early lows and edged higher against most of its rivals on Friday but was still on track for its biggest weekly drop in seven months as stronger equity markets and rising bond yields fueled a rush to buy riskier assets.
With trade war concerns receding in the background and emerging market central banks led by Turkey taking measures to stabilize their currencies, investors pushed the euro to the $1.18 line for the first time in more than three months.
""This is textbook risk-on behavior in the markets and, though it is hard to find an immediate catalyst, falling trade conflict concerns and improvement in emerging market sentiment has helped,"" said John Marley, a senior currency consultant at Smart Currency Business, and FX risk-management specialist.
Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Wednesday that Beijing will not engage in competitive currency devaluation, a day after his country and Washington plunged deeper into a trade war with more tit-for-tat tariffs.

By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth eased again in September, adding to signs that momentum in the currency bloc is well past its peak with country data for Germany and France also highlighting a slowdown, a survey showed on Friday.
While the regional slowdown was slightly sharper than expected, growth remained robust and firms were able to increase their prices, purchasing managers said, offering some comfort to policymakers at the European Central Bank.
But the surveys highlighted a divergence between services and manufacturing.
The bloc's dominant service industry beat forecasts for no change in the pace of growth from last month. IHS Markit's Euro Zone Services Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.7 from 54.4. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
Manufacturers, however, failed to live up to expectations. The factory PMI slumped to a two-year low of 53.3 from 54.6, significantly below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had a median prediction of 54.4.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI, sank to 52.8 from 54.7. It hasn't been lower since May 2016.
Suggesting little pick-up heading into the fourth quarter, factory new order growth also slowed sharply with the index falling to a 25-month low of 51.4 from 53.0. Exports, which include trade within the bloc, were flat.
""Euro zone industry continues to struggle with the global trade uncertainties coming from an imminent Brexit and the escalating global trade conflict,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday imposed a 10 percent tariff on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and threatened duties on around $267 billion more if Beijing retaliated, which it has done.
The euro ( ) dipped briefly after the PMI data but then recovered as investors gravitated to the view the latest exchange of tariffs between the United States and China may be less damaging than initially feared.
Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month unanimously said the U.S.-China trade war threatened the outlook for the euro zone and that economic growth will be modest at best over the coming year.
Still, the ECB plans to phase out its asset buying program this year and is expected to start interest rate hikes next autumn.
""As the index is still consistent with a fairly decent pace of growth, the ECB is unlikely to change its plans to normalize policy very gradually,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
IHS Markit said the composite PMI, which dipped in September to 54.2 from 54.5, below a median forecast in a Reuters poll for 54.4, pointed to GDP increasing 0.5 percent this quarter. The Reuters poll predicted 0.4 percent growth.
It was a similar story in the bloc's two biggest economies.
Earlier figures from Germany and France, the only two euro zone members for which flash data are published, showed growth slowed in both countries by more than was expected.
A euro zone composite future output index, which measures optimism, rose to 61.9 from August's 23-month low of 61.6. But official figures released on Thursday showed consumer confidence fell in September by more than expected.
Services firms increased headcount at the same strong pace as in August. The employment index - which is a lagging indicator - held steady at August's 55.3, a level which had not been seen since October 2007."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a seven-week low against a basket of major currencies, in part as safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency ebbed on relief that tariffs the United States and China imposed on each other's goods were set at lower levels than some had feared.

His comments came after China imposed new retaliatory levies on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods at scaled-back rates. Washington's new duties were set at 10 percent for now, before it is set to rise to 25 percent by the end of 2018, rather than an outright 25 percent.
""That the U.S. chose a lower rate seems to suggest it is making some allowances for China. Chinese Premier Li's comments on the yuan could be also seen as a overture to Washington,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.
""All in all, markets are hoping that the two sides will continue to talk and another round of tariffs could be avoided.""

Trump said that if China takes retaliatory action against U.S. farmers or industries, ""we will immediately pursue phase three, which is tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports.""
""Of immediate concern to the market is how China responds to the tariffs,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.

By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets headed south on Monday as investors took fright at news that Washington was set to announce a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods in the latest escalation of their trade conflict.
U.S. President Donald Trump's expected announcement of new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods drew an immediate threat of reprisals from Beijing.
Trump took to Twitter early on Monday to say: ""If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be ""Tariffed!""
The growing trade conflict between the world's two largest economies has long unnerved investors who fear an escalation could eventually whack global growth, while talks between the two countries have failed to make much headway.
The pan-European index fell as much as 0.2 percent, while Germany's DAX ( ), home to large exporters and carmakers, dropped half a percent. France's CAC 40 ( ) and Britain's FTSE 100 ( ) each fell 0.3 percent.
Last week, Europe's STOXX 600 had enjoyed its best weekly gain since July as the Turkish central bank's interest rate rise brought a broad relief rally, but the mood was less buoyant on Monday.
The falls in Europe followed weakness across Asian markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) dropped 1.2 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains.
The MSCI world equity index ( ), which tracks shares in 47 countries, remains more than 5 percent off its record high touched in January, and down 0.8 percent in September.
""On the Chinese side, Mr. Trump has burned a lot of political capital so it's hard to see how talks can resume if Mr. Trump goes ahead on the $200 billion,"" Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
""China's scope to retaliate is surprisingly limited, however, especially since the outbreak of swine flu, which will anyway push up CPI inflation,"" Beamish said, referring to the deadly swine fever strain that is seen impacting Chinese pork prices.
The S&P 500 e-minis ( ) fell 0.1 percent, indicating Wall Street would open slightly weaker.
FURTHER ESCALATION
Beamish doubted whether the United States would slap 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports, as the Trump administration has said it is considering, and the Wall Street Journal reported the tariff level would probably be about 10 percent.
Market watchers reckon further escalation is likely, although some investors think Trump's tariff threats are largely rhetoric aimed at a domestic audience before the mid-term elections in November. They expect tensions to ease once the vote is out of the way.
""I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs and I think [Trump is] trying to finish off with this matter until November,"" said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at Alpha Trust in Greece.
The dollar fell on Monday, suggesting investor nervousness was limited. The greenback tends to firm during bouts of trade tension as investors seek safety in the world's most liquid currency.
The greenback index ( ) slipped 0.2 percent at 94.725, having bounced from a low of 94.359 at the end of last week as Treasury yields rose.
The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1659 ( ) and the yen strengthened 0.1 percent to below 111 , with broader foreign exchange moves limited.
Emerging market currencies were mostly weaker after a strong run last week following the Turkish central bank's decision to sharply raise interest rates to shore up confidence in the lira.
The lira fell more than one percent to 6.2340 while Russia's rouble dropped 0.2 percent to 68.17 ( ) as the effect of a Russian central bank rate hike on Friday faded.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar sagged on Thursday as the pound led a bounce in European currencies, although skittish emerging market currencies and global trade concerns limited the greenback's losses.
The Australian dollar also dipped, failing to draw support from slightly better-than-expected domestic trade data.
The catalyst behind the dollar's fall was the pound, which spiked after Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the United Kingdom and Germany were prepared to drop a key sticking point in Brexit negotiations.
""The dollar continues to face residual pressure from the buoyant pound amid the latest speculation over Brexit. How long this lift could last remains to be seen, but it is prompting buy backs of other European currencies like the euro and Swiss franc for now,"" said Takuya Kanda, general manager at Gaitame.com Research.

Against the Swiss currency, the greenback lost 0.2 percent to 0.9699 franc per dollar . The dollar shed 0.2 percent to 111.31 yen .
The dollar may have pulled back but it was expected to stay well supported in the longer term, continuing to garner safe haven bids in the wake of weakness in emerging market currencies.
""The pound gained but its rise is likely to be temporary. The euro also rose thanks to the pound's bounce, but the currency faces strong headwinds in the form of Italy's fiscal issue and the economic crisis in Turkey,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""And with global trade concerns back at the fore, the dollar stands to benefit from an outflow of funds from emerging markets.""
The MSCI EM Currency Index ( ) slipped to its lowest since May 2017 on Wednesday.
A public comment period on the possibility of fresh U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, stoking fears of a major escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Emerging market currencies have been hit by fears that the global trade conflict would negatively affect their export-oriented economies.
Argentina's peso, which has lost more than 50 percent of its value this year, saw a rare pause in losses overnight.
Helping install a bit of investor confidence, Argentine Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne said on Tuesday he believed a deal to release early disbursements from a $50 billion standby loan agreement with the IMF could be put to its board by the end of the month.
The Argentine peso closed up more than 1 percent at 38.52 per dollar on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was 0.15 percent lower at $0.7185 .
As with the previous day, when strong gross domestic product data did not provide much of a lift, Thursday's economic indicators were unable to prop up the .
Australia's trade surplus in July was A$1.551 billion, above economists' forecasts of around A$1.4 billion, data on Thursday showed.
The Australian dollar remained in reach of $0.7145, its lowest since May 2016 plumbed the previous day. The currency, considered a barometer of broader risk sentiment, has taken heavy hits from recent turmoil in the emerging markets.
An uncertain economic outlook for China, Australia's key trading partner, has also weighed on the Aussie, which has declined about 8 percent so far in 2018."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Wednesday as concerns grew that U.S. President Donald Trump may soon ramp up a trade war with Beijing by imposing tariffs on more Chinese imports.
Trump could impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports after a public comment period on the new tariffs ends on Thursday, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen.
Investors wary of the deadline stayed loyal to the safe-haven greenback on Wednesday and it rose against major currencies like the euro and the British pound.
The greenback also drew further support from upbeat U.S. indicators underlining the case for further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The ( ), which measures the U.S. unit against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 95.442 as of 1100 GMT, not far off a two-week high of 95.737 reached during the previous session.
This year began with the dollar in retreat and investors convinced of further declines but now there appears to be very little to stop its ascent.
A crisis in the Turkish lira and the U.S.-China trade war have made the dollar a principal haven for investors seeking shelter and President Trump appears to be revelling in the strong dollar and its ability to bring pressure on his foes.
Since Tuesday, the dollar has gained more than 2 percent against the South African rand and the Argentine peso , and more than 1 percent against Mexican and Colombian pesos.
The greenback is up in 2018 against every major currency except the Mexican peso and Japanese yen. But some analysts believe the dollar may yet stumble before the year is out.
""Cyclical forces will start to work against the dollar: relative economic momentum, relative monetary policy expectations and relative political uncertainty will start to exhibit similar dynamics that weighed on the dollar in the second half of 2017,"" said Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING.
""Given the bleak global investment environment, we prefer to express our lower dollar versus majors view against safe-haven reserve currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc,"" Patel added.
The Australian dollar , which had been languishing at its weakest levels since mid-2016, gained on Wednesday after Australia posted its best economic growth in six years.
It advanced 0.3 percent to $0.7196 moving off its lowest level since May 2016, reached during the previous session.
The euro ( ) was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1597 and the British pound was down 0.2 percent at $1.2827.
Emerging market currencies fell overnight as investors feared export-oriented economies would be caught in the crossfire of any escalating trade conflict. A JPMorgan (NYSE: ) emerging market currency index ( ) on Wednesday hovered near a 15-month low reached during the previous session.
""As long as the United States and China are quarrelling, it's easy for commodity prices to fall, and commodity and emerging market currencies are easily sold as well,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains on Tuesday as concerns about a possible escalation in trade conflict between the United States and China prompted investors to dump emerging market currencies.
Against a basket of currencies ( ), the dollar rose half a percent and was set for its biggest daily rise since Aug. 23 to 95.55. It hit its highest level in more than a year at 96.98 in mid-August.
The public comment period on a U.S. proposal for new tariffs on Chinese goods is set to end on Thursday, after which U.S. President Donald Trump can follow through on plans to impose tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese imports, though it is unclear how quickly that will happen.
""The dollar seems to be the main defensive currency of choice as trade war concerns have picked up this week and that is causing problems for emerging markets,"" said Richard Falkenhall, a senior currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Emerging market currencies came in for special punishment as investors feared these export-oriented economies would be caught in the middle of any escalating trade conflict.
A JPMorgan (NYSE: ) emerging market currency index ( ) edged toward a more than one-year low hit in mid-August while the Indian rupee plummeted to a record low. The Turkish lira and the Mexican peso fell by more than a percent each.
""The general sentiment is that the dollar has not done too badly out of the trade war concerns, with concerns the U.S. might signal a fresh escalation in the trade conflict,"" said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ) in London.
The U.S. dollar's status as the chief reserve currency makes it the primary beneficiary of concern over trade conflicts.

On a positioning basis, markets are firmly in the stronger-dollar camp, with net outstanding positions holding just off the highest levels since January 2017, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.
Though main Chinese stock benchmarks ended up more than 1 percent, underlying investor sentiment remained wary with Chinese state-run banks seen intervening to support the local currency.
Major currencies were also caught in the widening sell-off in emerging markets, with the euro ( ) falling nearly half a percent at $1.1562 and the New Zealand dollar dropping nearly one percent to a 2-1/2-year low.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
Some analysts, however, said it was still too early for the Federal Reserve to declare victory on the inflation front as core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, reached 2% for just the third time this year in July, and annual comparisons are expected to get tougher.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a one-month low against a basket of its rivals on Tuesday as a U.S.-Mexico trade deal aimed at overhauling the North American Free Trade Agreement boosted appetite for riskier assets.
However, market moves were largely limited as some sort of a deal was expected by foreign exchange traders in recent days, with both the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso broadly flat against the greenback.
""The deal provides the impression that the U.S. President is less interested in causing a row at the moment but is making an effort to come home with constructive results from the theaters of trade war,"" said Esther Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE: ).
Against a basket of its rivals ( ), the dollar hit its lowest level since Aug. 2 at 94.68 in early Asian trades before consolidating its losses.
Despite the dollar's struggles against its major rivals, the euro ( ) was broadly steady around $1.1685 after Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio told an Italian paper the country's public deficit could exceed the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Among the major losers in the currency markets was sterling as London traders returned after a long weekend to more negative headlines on the Brexit front.
Against the euro ( ), sterling hit its weakest level in 2018 after the French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe asked his ministers to prepare contingency measures in case of a no-deal Brexit.
Shusuke Yamada, currency and equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) in Tokyo, said a de-escalation of trade tensions tended to be negative for the safe-haven yen, while supporting cross-yen trades.
""Cross-yen pairs like euro/yen ... have been a function of risk assets,"" Yamada said."

Trump suggested the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement would replace NAFTA, paving the way for Canada to rejoin talks, bringing Trump a step closer to overhauling NAFTA and reducing investor fears over a full-blown trade war.
Trump reportedly warned, however, that if a deal with Canada failed to materialized, then the U.S. would move ahead with tariffs on imported goods from Canada. This would dent the loonie as it throws into doubt expectations about a September rate hike, analysts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday as risk sentiment improved following reassuring Federal Reserve comments and signs U.S. and Mexican negotiators were homing in on a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At a symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed chair Jerome Powell on Friday emphasized the central bank's push to raise interest rates despite President Donald Trump's criticism of higher borrowing costs.
The Treasury yield curve reached its flattest level since 2007 - a factor seen as reducing support for the dollar - in the wake of Powell's speech.
His comments did little to change market expectations for rate hikes in September and December and disappointed some dollar bulls hoping for a more hawkish message.
""Some in the market were wrongfooted because they thought the Fed might shift toward an auto-pilot mode (approach to rate hikes) as it did in 2004. Obviously, Powell prefers a gradual approach,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at Commerzbank AG (DE: ) in Frankfurt.
""The return of risk appetite is negative for the dollar and its safe-haven appeal.""
The against a basket of six major currencies ( ) was broadly flat at 95.254 at 1100 GMT, after slipping more than 0.5 percent in the previous session.
Adding to the risk-on mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators appeared close to reaching a common position on NAFTA, with Mexico's economy minister saying on Sunday that talks had ""continued to make progress"".
""There is growing optimism that a US/Mexican agreement can be reached ...which in turn would allow Canada to re-join talks and progress to be made overall,"" said Kit Juckes, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ).
""We're never more than a tweet away from disaster on trade negotiations but for now, there's optimism.""
The Mexican peso was up 0.7 percent at 18.81 per dollar. Talks are scheduled to resume on Monday.
A prospective U.S. deal with Mexico ""takes a little bit of global trade war risk off the table"", said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING.
The euro was little changed at $1.1607 ( ) after going as high as $1.1654, its strongest since Aug. 2. The single currency advanced more than 0.7 percent on Friday.
The extended its rally in the onshore market to as high as 6.8061 per dollar , its strongest since Aug. 8.
The yuan had surged about 0.8 percent in onshore trade on Friday after the People's Bank of China said it was adjusting its methodology for fixing the yuan's daily midpoint, amid broad dollar strength and ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira weakened 3 percent against the dollar on Monday after a week-long holiday, hit by persisting concern about a diplomatic rift with Washington over a detained U.S. pastor.
The slide as local trading resumed left the lira down around 38 percent this year.
A broad retreat in emerging market currencies earlier this month had been a key source of strength for the greenback."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets rose to their highest level in more than two weeks on Monday as reassuring comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve chief, an easing in trade war jitters and a bid by China's central bank to stabilize the yuan lifted risk appetite.
A stronger-than-expected German business sentiment survey added to the upbeat mood in Europe, with stock markets in Paris and Frankfurt up 0.4 percent each ( ) ( ). British markets were closed for a public holiday.

That left the MSCI All-Country World index ( ), which tracks shares in 47 countries, at its highest level since Aug. 9.
Comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday affirming that the U.S. central bank was sticking with its strategy of gradual rate hikes to protect economic growth sparked a rally in stocks that gathered pace as a new week swung into gear.
Helping to brighten the mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators are seen as close to reaching a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo saying on Sunday talks have ""continued to make progress"".
The talks will resume on Monday and a positive outcome is expected to ease concerns about an escalation in global trade tensions.
""The (NAFTA) talks add to the sense that while the U.S. is still bogged down in its trade conflict with China, it is perhaps more willing to compromise elsewhere such as with Mexico and the EU,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at Commerzbank (DE: ) in Frankfurt.
""It's decreasing the risk of a global trade war.""

YUAN ON FIRMER GROUND
A strengthening in the , one causality of heightened trade tensions, also boosted sentiment in world markets.
The yuan hit a 2-1/2-week high versus the dollar after China's central bank revived a ""counter-cyclical factor"" in its daily fixing to support the currency, arresting a record 10-week slide that has rattled global markets and irritated Washington.
The announcement was seen as the latest signal from the People's Bank of China that is not comfortable with further depreciation in the yuan which could spark capital outflows from the cooling economy.
A firmer tone in the currency helped lift Chinese shares to two-week highs, with the Shanghai Composite index ( ) closing up 1.9 percent.
The move also raised hopes that a yuan recovery could boost companies with significant dollar-denominated costs, such as airlines. China Southern Airlines (SS: ) gained 4.5 percent and Air China (SS: ) rose 3.25 percent.
""China just seems to be stabilizing its currency and we're getting used to that fact now, so we're not looking at an ever-weaker CNY, which could raise issues,"" said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, adding that ""it reduces the scope for outflows"".

On Friday, the S&P 500 index ( ) and Nasdaq Composite ( ) hit record highs, following Powell's comments. The gains cemented the S&P's longest-running bull market, as defined by some investors.
S&P 500 E-mini futures ( ) touched a record high of 2,885 during the Asia session, and were last up 0.25 percent at 2,883.75.
In Europe, data on Monday showed German business morale improved by much more than expected in August, suggesting that concerns about a global trade war among company executives in Europe's largest economy have eased.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index jumped to 103.8 after 101.7 in the previous month.
That added to the upbeat tone in equity markets but weighed on safe-haven German bond yields, which rose to more than two-week highs ( ).
""We have low volumes today, but the biggest risks the market were discounting were trade wars, so any reduction in trade war risk such as NAFTA talks or even Trump trying to find bilateral deals with everyone, has pushed U.S. shares to new records and will support markets,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities and a portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Italy.
""The global economy is on track, there's less trade war risk, the only cloud on the horizon is Italy,"" Meda added, referring to upcoming budget talks in the weeks ahead.

The , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.55% to 95.02.
Powell, in support of the Fed's glacial approach to tightening, underlined two risks facing the economy. He said too fast a pace of tightening could ""needlessly"" undermine economy growth, while too slow a pace would risk the economy overheating.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the [Federal Open Market Committee’s] approach to taking seriously both of these risks.” Powell said in speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Analysts touted a far more dovish scenario for monetary policy, citing a risk of slowing rate hikes should inflation remain grounded.
""While the Fed is on its one-hike-per-quarter path this year, should inflation stay relatively grounded, the balance of risk approach that Powell talks about could lean towards a somewhat slower pace of tightening in 2019, as rates get closer to where the Fed might see the neutral rate lying,"" CIBC said.
Powell's speech largely overshadowed data showing core durable goods orders undershot expectations, though analysts were quick to downplay the weakness as the underlying data indicated strong capital expenditure growth.

""The (headline number) 1.7% decline was driven by a huge dive in the always choppy aircraft component, a segment in which orders go with a long lag towards actual activity.

The United States and China escalated their months-long trade war, implementing punitive 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods, rattling investors who have usually sought safety in the dollar.

""Given our view that U.S. dollar bullishness has become a little excessive, this speech on Friday could well be a catalyst for a sharp reversal the other way as long dollar positions are pared.""
Emerging markets were mostly lower although losses were small.
The Turkish lira snapped a three-day rebound on Friday, sliding more than 5 percent against the dollar on fears the United States would impose more economic sanctions unless Turkey handed over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson. On Monday the lira fell 1.5 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose for a second day in a row on Friday as hopes that next week's talks between the United States and China will ease trade tensions between the two pushed the dollar lower.
The Turkish lira's continued recovery helped some emerging market currencies, although the slipped slightly after Thursday's big rise, underlining investor nervousness about volatility in developing markets.
The euro has been under pressure in recent weeks on worries about euro zone bank exposure to Turkey after the lira crashed this month. Concerns that Italy's governing parties will agree a budget with high public spending have also weighed on the single currency.
The dollar has benefited as investors rush towards safety.
Alvin Tan, FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ), said Friday's moves were more to do with dollar weakness as investors show greater appetite for taking on risk than euro strength.
""Volatility seems to have fizzled out in the last 24 hours and the stability in the remninbi has helped emerging market currencies,"" he said.
The euro ticked 0.1 percent higher to $1.1385 ( ) while the - a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies - fell 0.1 percent to 96.513 ( ).
Still, analysts saw limits to any euro rebound.
""Considering that European banks' exposure to Turkey is relatively limited, this week's reaction by the euro looked overdone. But the rise in Italian bond yields amid the country's fiscal concerns may continue indefinitely and limit the bounce by the euro,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.
The Japanese yen , up 0.1 percent to 110.74, and sterling also capitalized on the greenback's weakness to move higher.
China and the United States agreed on Thursday to hold a new round of trade talks on Aug. 21-22, supporting the yuan.
The Chinese currency's slide in recent months, partly on the back of concerns about what a full-blown trade war with the U.S. would do to China's economy, has rattled investors.
After a recovery on Thursday, the yuan in offshore markets slipped 0.2 percent to 6.8727 , still far below its 2018 lows of 6.9587.
The Turkish lira rose half a percent to 5.7933 per dollar as sentiment improved. The closure of Turkish financial markets for a string of national holidays during Aug. 21-24 also provided some respite.
The lira plunged to a record low of 7.24 on Monday before mounting a three-day rebound, helped by factors including measures by the Turkish central bank to support its currency and Qatar's pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey.
However, there are still concerns over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's policies to combat the country's double-digit inflation and his row with Washington over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson."

Investing.com - The dollar was flat against its rivals Thursday, pressured by a bout of mixed U.S. economic data and improving risk sentiment after the U.S. confirmed trade talks with China would resume.
The , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.01% to 96.58.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed Thursday that the U.S. and China will resume trade talks later this month, ending a two-month stalemate during which both countries have imposed billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on each other's goods.
Concerns over Turkey eased as lira continued its recovery from a slump earlier in the week, underpinning risk sentiment, after Turkish financial minister Berat Albayrak reportedly told investors that the government would tighten fiscal policy and ruled out capital controls.
But analysts said the ""half-measures"" implemented by Turkey this week were unlikely to pull its economy from the brink and called for the country to adopt a policy overhaul.
""These exemplify the half-measures that are unlikely to restore confidence,"" Berenberg Bank said. ""Considering the country shows the 'classic signs' of economic overheating, Turkey needs to rise interest rates and implement fiscal prudence, including less reliance on credit-financed vanity projects such as the next mega-airport or a channel to bypass the Bosporus.""
The dollar was also knocked by mixed U.S. economic data on housing and regional manufacturing.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday fell 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.168 million units in July, well below economists’ estimates for a 7.4% rise.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Thursday from its weakest since late June 2017 and the dollar fell after news that a Chinese delegation will travel to the United States for trade talks, with investors buying back into currencies hit hard in the recent sell-off.
Many emerging market currencies also rose, clawing back some of Wednesday's losses thanks to easing fears over the knock-on effects from a slide in the Turkish lira.
Global equity markets were mixed, however, underlining how nervous investors remain.
""That China and the U.S. are beginning to talk again is supporting the market,"" said Commerzbank (DE: ) currencies strategist Thu Lan Nguyen. ""As the (Turkish) lira did not depreciate further, that has taken out some tension from the market.""
She also emphasized that the currency crisis in Turkey is far from over because authorities have yet to tackle the root causes.
More important for major currencies on Thursday were developments in the months-long trade conflict between the United States and China.
China's Ministry of Commerce said it had received an invitation from the United States for talks to be held with U.S. Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass.
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1367 ( ), away from Wednesday's low of $1.1301.
The dollar, which has gained on bouts of investor jitters as traders seek safety in the higher-yielding and most liquid currency, fell after a recent strong run. The slipped 0.1 percent to 96.613 ( ).
China's yuan, which has fallen in recent months on concerns about the impact on its economy of the trade conflict with the United States, gained 0.7 percent in offshore markets to 6.9005 .
APPARENT CALM
Emerging market currencies bounced across the board, including the South African rand , the Mexican peso and Russian rouble ( ).
Turkey's lira rallied about 3 percent to 5.7923 before a presentation by Finance Minister Berat Albayrak to investors, but is still down 34 percent against the dollar this year.
Despite Thursday's calm, analysts remain cautious about the outlook for markets, particularly those outside of the United States that have looked vulnerable whenever investors get nervous.
Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said ""a seeming disconnect between U.S. markets and those elsewhere is becoming increasingly obvious"", given the performance of U.S. equities and the dollar in 2018.
""The risk is that the apparent calm in U.S. markets may be giving U.S. investors a false read about how volatile the next few months might prove for global markets,"" Derrick said.
The yen paused after its recent run, with the dollar gaining 0.1 percent to 110.84 yen .

The dollar was lower against the traditional safe haven yen, with losing 0.2% to trade at 110.93.
Investors often gravitate to the Japanese currency during times of financial or political turmoil.
The gains in the dollar came as the Turkish lira extended a modest recovery, with hitting an intraday low of 5.9230, before pulling back to 6.1215.
It was the first time the lira crossed back below the psychologically important 6-lira-to-the-dollar level since plunging to record lows on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday to its highest levels in over a year as a crisis in the Turkish lira that has spread to emerging markets fed demand for the greenback as a safe-haven asset.
Signs the U.S. economy remains robust ahead of an expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month have seen the dollar dominate other currencies in recent weeks.
A plunge in the lira which has hurt the euro on concerns about European banks' exposure to Turkey has driven further demand for the dollar along with other safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.
Against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, the dollar rose to 96.862, its highest level since late June 2017. ( )
""In light of all the turmoil we've seen out of Turkey and the subsequent contagion into other emerging markets, the dollar is pretty much establishing itself as the safe-haven currency,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
""If you are going to park your money somewhere to stay away from the turmoil, the dollar is going to be the currency of choice,"" he said.
The lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's calls for lower interest rates and fraying ties with the United States.
On Wednesday, however, the lira recovered some ground to trade briefly at 5.7503 to the U.S. dollar, firming from a close of 6.3577 a day earlier.
The rebound to below 6.0 against the dollar was driven by a banking watchdog step to limit swap transactions and by hopes of improved EU relations.
Turkey's finance minister will also seek to reassure international investors in a conference call on Thursday.
Markets are concerned by President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over the economy and his resistance to interest rate increases to tackle double-digit inflation.
The rally in the dollar prompted selling in both the euro and the British pound.
The single currency drifted down toward $1.13 for the first time since July 2017 ( ) and sterling dipped below $1.27 for the first time since June last year.
The euro is under pressure because of the impact of the Turkish lira collapse on euro zone banks with exposure to Turkey and due to concerns about a fiscal spending spree by the Italian government which is involved in a standoff with Brussels.
""The attractive rate advantage of U.S. bonds is strengthening demand for the dollar. Combined with doubts over the [monetary] normalization efforts of the European Central Bank this limits the upside potential in EUR-USD for now,"" said Commerzbank (DE: ) FX analyst Esther Maria Reichelt.
Investors are worried that the market turbulence caused by Turkey's economic meltdown might delay the ECB’s normalization timetable, she said.
Investors remain nervous about the plunge in the lira, prompting capital outflows from other emerging markets that run hefty current account deficits and rely on foreign capital.
Against the yen , the dollar rose about 0.1 percent to about 111.27 yen.
The pound hit a 13-month low, dropping 0.2 percent to $1.2694 on the back of weaker-than-forecast wage growth figures released on Tuesday.

Fears of market contagion were somewhat justified after reports surfaced that the European Central Bank was assessing its exposure to Turkey.
Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed that banks in Spain, France and Italy had the highest exposure to the Turkish economy at the end of the first quarter, adding up to $81 billion, $35 billion and $18 billion respectively.
Analysts, however, were quick to downplay the impact on European banks, citing most of the exposure was to Turkish equity, and not a falling lira.

(Bloomberg) -- As U.S. President Donald Trump takes aim at Turkey, the euro is getting caught in the crossfire.
Turkey’s plunged to a record low Friday amid escalating tension over the detention of an American pastor, with Trump ordering some tariffs on Turkish metals to be doubled. The carnage quickly spread from emerging to developed markets: The euro sank as much as 1 percent to the weakest in more than a year, extending a drop triggered earlier by a Financial Times report that the European Central Bank raised concern about European banks’ exposure to Turkey.
Barring a quick resolution to the U.S.-Turkey feud, the common currency will continue to suffer amid worries about the vulnerability of European financial institutions, according to Shahab Jalinoos, Credit Suisse (SIX: ) Group AG’s global head of FX trading strategy.
“As long as the market suspects the European banking sector has an exposure, it will weigh on the euro, even if that’s hard to quantify,” Jalinoos said. “It will be sold on rallies unless Turkey suddenly gets cleared up, especially as the market knows the euro has its own Italy budget risk still ahead.”
The fell as low as $1.1414 Friday, and is now down almost 5 percent this year versus the dollar. Jalinoos has his sights set on the euro’s 200-week moving average at $1.1367 as the next point to watch. He said that level acted as resistance in the second half of 2016.
The greenback gained against almost all major and emerging-market currencies Friday, underscoring the haven appeal that’s boosting it to the likely dismay of the U.S. president."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a 13-month high against a basket of currencies on Friday and the yen also made big strides, with investor appetite for risk dropping amid escalating global trade tensions and diplomatic wrangling.
The euro fell to its weakest since July 2017, while the pound dropped to its lowest in a year amid speculation Britain will leave the European Union without an agreement regarding its future relationship with Brussels.
The ( ), which measures the greenback's strength against a group of six major currencies, climbed more than 0.6 percent to 96.103, its highest since July 2017.
The greenback has been boosted by growing global trade tensions and strained geopolitical relationships, with the United States this week saying it would impose fresh sanctions on Moscow. Washington is also embroiled in a diplomatic feud with Turkey.
Russia would consider it an economic war if the United States imposed a ban on banks or a particular currency, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday, the TASS state news agency said.
""There are all sorts of uncertainties and concerns in the markets currently, with the U.S.-China spat a well established one, but concerns over the European Union, Britain and Turkey also in the air,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.
""And amidst all this, the yen is suddenly back in vogue as a safe-haven. The dollar and yen are serving as safe-havens at the same time.""
With the dollar seen to be absorbing safe-haven flows, the yen's gains against the greenback were limited. The Japanese currency, however, rallied against other peers such as the euro, pound and Australian dollar.
The euro was down 0.75 percent at 127.13 yen ( ), the pound lost 0.25 percent to 142.03 yen ( ) and the shed 0.85 percent to 81.29 yen ( ).
The Turkish lira hit an all-time low of 6.49 on Friday after a meeting the day before between a Turkish delegation and U.S. officials in Washington yielded no apparent solution to a diplomatic rift over the detention in Turkey of a U.S. pastor.
""Even in the unlikely event that Turkey resolves its diplomatic row with the United States, downside concerns towards the lira won't ease,"" said Takahiko Sasaki, market economist at Mizuho Bank.
Turkey is saddled with a mountain of short-term external debt, a high current account deficit and accelerating inflation, Sasaki said.
Meanwhile, the pound has slumped 1.55 percent this week amid worries about a so-called 'hard' Brexit.
Sterling fell roughly 0.2 percent $1.2830 on Friday, plumbing a fresh one-year low of $1.2798.
The euro dropped 0.6 percent to $1.1438 ( ), its weakest since July 2017.
The single currency had already suffered deep losses overnight, its decline accelerating after the European Central Bank said that risks to global growth are increasing as the risk of protectionism and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs sap confidence.
The euro was down almost 1 percent for the week, dogged by renewed investor concerns that Italy was heading for a costly and unsustainable spending spree.
The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 110.98 yen , nudged off a session-high of 111.165. The pair has been caught in a relatively narrow 111.53-110.68 band this week.
The U.S. consumer price inflation (CPI) report for July is expected to show inflation likely increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.1 percent in June.
The United States and Japan on Thursday began what the two sides call ""free, fair and reciprocal"" negotiations on trade, with the discussions due to continue on Friday.
ROUBLE WOES
The rouble retreated overnight to its lowest since November 2016, weakening beyond the psychologically important 65-per-dollar threshold.
The weakened about 0.55 percent to 6.855 against the dollar in spot trading , handing back the previous day's gains.
The yuan has slipped about 0.4 percent this week, weighed down as the market remained bearish on the near-term outlook for the currency amid the trade war between Washington and Beijing.
Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar remained on the back foot, stretching its overnight slide to $0.6586 , its lowest since March 2016.
The lost 2 percent on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised the market by committing to holding rates at record lows until the end of 2020."

Investing.com - The dollar traded higher against its rivals Thursday, shrugging off a mixed economic data as traders continue to bet a stronger U.S. economy would underpin the greenback amid lingering trade-war tensions.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that dropped by 6,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Aug. 3, beating economists’ forecast for a rise to 220,000.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its for final demand was flat last month after rising 0.3% in June. In the 12 months through August, the PPI rose 3.3%, compared with expectations for a 3.4% rise.
Analysts downplayed the weaker-than-expected data and blamed the slowdown in wholesale prices on the volatile trade services component.
The trade-services component did most of the damage, which was a story of softness in fuels, lubricants and machinery, RBC said.
""If we strip out trade services from core, it would have been up 0.3%,"" the bank added.
The dollar remained supported, however, on expectations that U.S. would fare better in a trade war than China as the U.S. economy is less dependent on exports.
“You have rising income, rising labor participation, rising confidence, and all of that consumer spending accounts for two thirds of our (U.S.) GDP,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York last week. “Our starting position is much stronger than the Chinese because trade doesn’t matter as much to the American economy.”
The dollar was also supported by slump in the euro and weakness in the pound.

By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar's march higher against major currencies will run out of road within the next six months, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists, who have held on to that view since May.
While the greenback fell about 3 percent in the first few months of the year, since mid-April the ( ) has risen more than 6 percent, supported by investors seeking safety in U.S. assets on concerns over the impact of trade tariffs.
Those concerns are well-founded; the U.S. trade representative's office said on Tuesday it would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of goods imported from China later this month, and China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree.
The dollar fell a quarter of a percent against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, its biggest drop in a week, suggesting its fear-driven rally is showing signs of fading despite escalating trade disputes.
The latest Reuters poll of more than 60 currency analysts, taken from Aug. 3 to 8, suggested all major currencies will be higher than they are now against the dollar in six months and in a year.
A slight majority - 29 of 52 analysts - who answered an additional question said they were not confident the dollar would be able to maintain its strength over the next six months. The remaining 23 said they were either confident or very confident.
The dollar may struggle to move much higher, given that currency positioning by speculators is close to the most bullish on the dollar since January 2017, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
There was even more clarity when asked if the dollar rally could last a year, with 37 of 52 analysts saying they were not confident, including 13 who said they were not confident at all.
""It has had a 6 or 7 percent rise in the last three months - but it is flattening out...and is showing already that there is a resistance among investors to take the dollar further up,"" said Gavin Friend, senior market strategist at NAB.
""We are not saying the dollar has peaked here. It might have a little bit of further strength to go, but by the time we get into the back-end of this year, the dollar will start to ease off again.""
China's yuan, actively managed by the Chinese authorities but which has taken the biggest hit from the ongoing trade wrangling, is now expected to cut some of its losses against the dollar and appreciate over the coming year. [CNY/POLL]
The yuan held firm near a one-week high versus the dollar on Wednesday, extending its rise after the central bank took some steps to curb the currency's decline.
The market has already fully priced in most of the factors which have aided the dollar rally, including the threat of a full-blown trade war, robust economic performance and interest rate differentials. So any further gains in the currency will be limited.
While better-than-expected economic performance in the United States and higher interest rates there than elsewhere could still benefit the dollar, a separate Reuters poll showed U.S. economic growth likely peaked in the second quarter. [ECILT/US]
Economists who had accurately forecast the U.S. economy to expand 4.1 percent in the quarter just ended said that may be the peak for the world's largest economy.
""The dollar has been winning so far because of two things - one is this trade war...and the other is that the Federal Reserve is the only central bank out there which is tightening in a sustained way,"" said Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING Bank.
""Unless we get even stronger growth in the third quarter, which the data so far hasn't suggested - and if that is the case then it is hard to price-in another level of dollar strength.""
Interest rate differentials may also stop widening soon as the Fed is largely expected to stay on its current path and the European Central Bank has said it will wind down its massive stimulus program by end-2018. It is then predicted to raise rates around this time next year.
The euro ( ), which is down over 3 percent this year so far, is forecast to regain most of those losses to $1.19 in six months from around $1.16, where it was trading on Wednesday. It is then forecast to rise to $1.23 in a year, unchanged from July's poll.
Median expectations for the single currency had fallen from the prior poll for three straight months until this survey.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hovered around the $1.16 mark on Wednesday but failed to capitalise on a pause in the dollar's rally, while solid data out of China calmed nerves about recent Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
The dollar has weakened since hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the currency. Traders said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in the trade tensions to move higher.
""The Chinese trade data, coupled with the PBOC moves, is helping quieten markets, with range-bound trading,"" said Valentin Marinov, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole (PA: ). ""The main driver for markets at the moment is dollar buying and selling.""

Sentiment is likely to remain dominant, however, and markets remain vulnerable to headline risk and President Trump’s twitter feed,"" said Christophe Barraud at Paris-based Market Securities.
Traders say market sensitivity to trade war headlines has diminished and investors will want to see evidence the dispute is having real impact before they panic.
China's July trade data, the first since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, showed a faster-than-expected rise in China's exports and imports. The country's trade surplus with the United States was little changed.
In a reminder the dispute has not disappeared, however, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday that the U.S. would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods later this month.
The yen rose half a percent after reports that Bank of Japan board members had disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target. The yen rose to 110.84, a one-week high .
The Australian dollar, seen as a proxy for China risk, slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7413 .

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares edged toward a six-month high on Tuesday, as the biggest jump in Chinese stocks for over two years and an upbeat start for Europe followed Wall Street's best close since January.
The moves came despite a host of simmering global feuds. Oil prices ticked higher as the United States reimposed some sanctions on Iran, while the Turkish lira bounced back almost 2 percent from its worst day in a decade on Monday that had been prompted by a row with Washington. ( )
The mood lifted overnight as Chinese stocks rebounded 2.7 percent on hopes of fresh government spending, following a four-day selloff that had knocked them down about 6 percent. ( )
London ( ), Paris ( ) and Frankfurt ( ) followed by rising 0.6 to 0.9 percent as Europe's investors cheered results from Italy's biggest bank UniCredit ( ) and oil firms and miners gained on the rise in crude prices. ( ) ( )
""The Chinese have stabilized the yuan, the lira hasn't been annihilated this morning so once the sharp FX moves have calmed down and as long as the (company) earnings are good, you have a more risk friendly environment,"" said Societe Generale (PA: ) strategist Kit Juckes.
Currency markets remained volatile although less so than in recent sessions as the dollar dipped.
The euro bounced to $1.1583 ( ) from a near six-week low despite a second day of disappointing German economic data, while Britain's pound made back some ground after Brexit worries had pushed it to an 11-month low. [/FRX]
Turkey’s lira recovered 1.7 percent from Monday's losses of more than 5 percent after Washington had moved to end duty-free access to U.S. markets for some Turkish exports. A report by CNN Turk that Turkish officials would go to Washington to discuss the strained relations helped the rise, although the lira remains close to a record low.
Already struggling with inflation at 14-year highs near 16 percent and political pressure on the central bank not to raise interest rates, the lira’s year-to-date losses are nearing 30 percent as jitters about foreign currency debt payments rise.
""Currently the impact of the lira's slide is mostly contained within the country. But fears of a default will begin to increase if the currency keeps depreciating,"" said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""Such a development could affect some European financial institutions,"" he added.

China vowed on Thursday to retaliate if the U.S. acted on a threat to raise tariffs on the Asian nation's exports, after U.S. President Donald Trump instructed his trade officials to look at increasing tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese imports into the United States.
But, as the United States imports far more from China, than China does from the United States, investors see a trade war causing greater pain for the Chinese economy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up against the yuan and growth-leveraged currencies on Wednesday after a source familiar with the Trump administration's plans said the White House was about to propose higher tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports.
The news came as a survey showed China's factory sector grew at the slowest pace in eight months in July as export orders declined yet again.
The dollar added 0.4 percent to 6.8306 yuan after reports circulated President Donald Trump would propose tariffs of 25 percent, instead of 10 percent, in an announcement that could come as early as Wednesday.
The yuan has now fallen for four months in a row and China's central bank on Wednesday set the currency at its weakest since May last year.

The dollar was also holding the whip hand against the yen after Tuesday's pledge by the Bank of Japan to keep rates extremely low for an extended period.

""Relative to other major central banks, the BoJ is now decisively the last cab off the easy policy rank,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.

In contrast, solid U.S. economic growth is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track for another two hikes this year as it concludes its policy meeting later in the day.
Data out Tuesday showed U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in June even as wage growth stayed restrained.
The core PCE index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier for a third straight month, near the Fed's two-percent inflation target.
""Though the tariff tantrum ramped up a bit since the last FOMC confab, the core of the Fed is thus far unconvinced that this warrants any material shift in the outlook,"" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.
""Our core view remains that the Fed is poised to raise the funds rate by additional 50 basis points this year and another 100 basis points in 2019.""
The Bank of England holds its policy meeting on Thursday and markets are pricing in a near-90 percent chance of a quarter-point hike in rates."

""The dollar will remain caught between the lift from such fundamental factors and downward pressure from political factors, such as President Trump's attempts to keep dollar strength in check.""

The dollar's retreat came after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed displeasure over the currency's strength and amid speculation that the Bank of Japan could scaled back its massive monetary stimulus soon.
The pound was 0.05 percent lower at $1.3104 . It had dropped 0.6 percent overnight as a stronger dollar and mounting uncertainty over Brexit negotiations offset the positive impact of bets on a Bank of England interest rate hike next week. [GBP/]"

481,2018-07-20,Forex - Dollar on Track for Weekly Drop as Trump Blasts Fed Policy,"© Reuters. The Dollar fell sharply against its rivals Friday
Investing.com – The dollar fell sharply Friday as President Donald Trump continued to slam the Federal Reserve's monetary policy measures arguing that higher interest rates were denting the United States' ""big competitive edge.""
The , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.64% to 94.37. The slump in the dollar index saw it turn negative for the week after hitting fresh 52-week highs of 95.44 Thursday intraday.
Trump took to Twitter to express concerns about a stronger U.S. dollar, which he said was “taking away our [United States] big competitive edge.” As well as the Fed's approach to monetary policy, other central banks were also criticized by Trump as he claimed they were “manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower.”
Trump's comments – a break away from a long-standing norm of sitting presidents avoiding commentary on Fed policy – won't affect the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy decision, according to St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard.
“The FOMC has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it’s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,” Bullard said.
Trump's remarks came amid renewed focus on U.S. trade war tensions after the president said he was ""ready"" to slap on Chinese goods imported to the U.S.
That raised demand for safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss Franc.

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar slumped on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Federal Reserve and threatened to impose fresh tariffs on China.
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.65% to 94.36 as of 10:35 AM ET (14:35 GMT).
Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he is to the U.S. if China does not back down on its trade policies.
“I’m not doing this for politics, I’m doing this to do the right thing for our country” he said on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box."" “We have been ripped off by China for a long time.”
In another statement, Trump criticized the Fed for increasing interest rates. The Fed raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates at least once more before the end of the year.
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard responded to Trump’s comments, saying the Fed would not be impacted.
“The [Fed] has a mandate to keep inflation low and stable and obtain maximum employment for the U.S. economy, so people can comment, including the president and other politicians, but it’s up to the committee to try to take the best action we can to achieve those objectives,” he said.
The dollar was lower against the safe-haven yen, with decreasing 0.71% to 111.65. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to invest in the Japanese yen, which is considered a safe asset during periods of risk aversion.

(Bloomberg) -- The has been treading water. It is unlikely to find a rescuing hand from the European Central Bank, whose policy makers next week.
While analysts expect the shared currency to strengthen as the year progresses, conviction in that view is shaky, with strategists having pared their calls recently. The euro was knocked down after the ECB’s mid-June policy review, when President Mario Draghi dashed expectations for tightening in early 2019. Since then, trade tensions have heightened and core inflation in the euro area has been revised downward, which gives the ECB little incentive to change tack any time soon.
The policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and the ECB is another factor that is curbing enthusiasm on the euro. Shorter-term bond yields, which are usually more sensitive to changing views on monetary policy, are in favor of the dollar: the two-year yield differential between U.S. Treasuries and German bunds widened this week to more than 300 basis points, the most in data going back to 1990.
The euro has weakened about 2.5 percent so far this year and has been confined to an about 300-pip range since May. The currency was at $1.1700 on Friday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey is for it to climb to $1.1800 by the end of this year, but this prediction is lower than the $1.2600 forecast in May.
Concerns that the current tariff spat between the U.S. and China could transform into a currency war is likely to draw concern from the ECB. Policy makers “will focus on potential communication on the short-term downside risk stemming from protectionism,” Danske Bank analysts including Piet PH Christiansen said in a client note this week.

The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% to 94.84 as of 5:36 AM ET (9:36 GMT).
Despite the dip, the dollar was on target for a second straight week of gains and has risen more than 5% in the last three months due to expectations that interest rates will rise.
Trump said in an interview on CNBC that he does not approve of how the Fed is approaching monetary policy. The Fed raised rates twice this year and is expected to raise rates at least once more before the end of the year.
“I’m not thrilled,” Trump said. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don't really — I am not happy about it. But at the same time I’m letting them do what they feel is best.”
Meanwhile trade tensions continued, with the European Union expected to retaliate against the U.S. with more tariffs after America imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in June. Tariffs on around $3.8 billion of U.S. goods have already been imposed by Europe.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held below a one-year high on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed concern about a stronger currency, although a weakening reduced risk appetite.
The dollar is poised for a second straight week of gains and has gained more than 5 percent in the past three months on expectations the U.S. central bank will keep raising interest rates in the coming months.
But in a CNBC interview on Thursday, Trump said a strong dollar puts the United States at a disadvantage and that the Chinese yuan ""was dropping like a rock"".
""The comments are more likely to, on the margin, stem flows into dollar assets given renewed uncertainty over the U.S. administration’s dollar policy,"" ING strategists said.
Against a basket of other currencies ( ), the dollar held at 95.19, just below the one-year high of 95.62 it reached in the previous session.
But risk appetite remained subdued after China allowed the currency to weaken by lowering its daily midpoint fixing. The People's Bank of China dropped the midpoint for a seventh straight trading day to 6.7671 per dollar on Friday, 605 pips or 0.9 percent weaker than the previous fix of 6.7066.
Friday's fixing was the lowest since July 14, 2017, and represented the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since June 27, 2016.
""The Chinese currency really seems like it might be in play again rather than just catching up with a stronger dollar,"" Rabobank strategists said in a daily note.
The Australian dollar was barely changed at $0.7364, recouping losses after dropping nearly half a percent in early trade.

Powell said gradual interest rate hikes would be ""the best way forward"" for the economy, citing stronger labor markets, and inflation that had met the Fed's 2% objective.

Overall retail sales growth for the second quarter came in at the strongest level since 2004 despite the fall in June. The month of June is purported to have been weaker as a result of hotter weather and England’s unexpected success in the World Cup.
The combination of wage growth, soft inflation and now disappointing retail sales for the month of June may give the Bank of England food for thought when the Monetary Policy Committee meet in August to set interest rates.

By Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged down on Tuesday ahead of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell which traders will scrutinize for clues on the pace of U.S. interest rate rises and risks emanating from trade conflicts.
Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee at 1400 GMT on Tuesday.
He is expected to deliver an upbeat message on the outlook for growth and reaffirm the Fed's gradual monetary tightening policy but could face tough questions on the central bank's independence and how it would deal with an escalation in the global trade war.
""The escalating trade conflict is becoming an increasingly realistic downside risk that could weigh on sentiment and capital spending,"" said Societe Generale (PA: ) analyst Guy Stear.
""It is questionable how much longer the top central banker will be able to and will want to remain so reserved in view of increasing tensions.""
At 0745 GMT the dollar traded down 0.2 percent at 94.37 ( ) against a basket of six major currencies, paring small gains booked during early morning trade.
The U.S. currency traded flat against the yen to 112.27 yen , after having approached earlier in the session a six-month high of 112.80 yen reached on July 13.
The dollar's gains have this year been capped by worries over the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China, although the concerns have not derailed the greenback's solid performance so far.
The International Monetary Fund had warned on Monday that escalating and sustained trade conflicts following U.S. tariff action threaten to derail economic recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects.
Analysts are uncertain how the Fed would react if the conflict over trade with China deteriorates: either with aggressive rate hikes due to the inflationary effect of the import tariffs or with a pause in the hiking cycle due to growth dampening.
""[If the trade war worsens] I would expect that the U.S. dollar would initially appreciate as the result of a flight into safe havens, with it probably benefiting even more in case of aggressive rate hikes,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX strategist at Commerzbank AG (DE: ) in Frankfurt.
Other major currency pairs on Tuesday stuck to tight ranges.
The euro ( ) and British pound rose modestly against the greenback. The single currency added 0.2 percent to $1.1738 after weakening half a percent last week while the pound was up 0.1 percent at $1.3255.
The Australian dollar edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7428. The currency is down more than 5 percent since the start of the year because of a divergence in the interest rate outlook of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Australia's central bank which is seen keeping policy steady for some while yet."

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that the United States and China could reopen trade talks, briefly easing concerns about the trade dispute.
But data showing China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to a record in June as exports grew could further inflame tensions. Trump this week pledged to impose tariffs on $200 billion more of Chinese imports and Beijing has vowed to retaliate.
""The trade conflict is dominating concerns in the market,"" said Esther Reichelt, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE: ) in Frankfurt. ""These are sentiment-driven moves.""
The single currency dropped to as low as $1.1613 ( ), down 0.4 percent. The reached a two-week high at 95.232 ( ).
The safe-haven yen fell to another six-month low at 112.775 yen , however, suggesting investors were not panicking.
The dollar has advanced roughly 2 percent versus the yen this week, the biggest weekly gain since mid-September.
INFLATION GAIN
The dollar's broad rally on Friday was also fueled by U.S. consumer prices data a day earlier. That showed a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018.
While rising inflation is largely expected by markets, it will reinforce the view of a ""widening in monetary policy divergence"" between the Federal Reserve and other central banks, said Piotr Matys, FX strategist at Rabobank.
""The latest set of inflation data confirms that the Fed will stay well ahead of other central banks,"" he said. ""We believe the dollar has the potential to extend its rally.""
European Central Bank minutes published on Thursday also weighed on the euro, showing that members remain dovish and are a long way from normalizing policy.
U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Britain's Brexit plan killing hopes of a U.S. trade deal also knocked sterling lower, pushing the dollar up further.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held at a nine-day high on Thursday, bolstered by concern U.S. inflation pressures will pick up, although worries about an escalation in trade conflict capped gains.
The conventional wisdom is that any escalation in trade conflict between the United States and its trading partners will feed through to inflation and prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least twice more this year. But market watchers fear the dollar may have peaked for now.
With the stimulus effect from U.S. tax cuts expected to wane next year and worries that the trade war rhetoric may fuel a selloff in global stock markets, some analysts advise caution in buying the dollar at these levels.
""If stocks drop sharply then the Fed will pause and moreover, we think the U.S. is toward the end of its rate hike cycle,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE: ) in Frankfurt.
Having raised interest rates seven times since December 2015 to 2 percent, markets expect three or four rate hikes by the end of 2019.
But despite the widening interest rate differentials in favor of the dollar -- spreads between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and equivalent German Bunds are near 30-year highs at 2.59 percent -- the dollar has failed to power ahead in recent days, notably against the euro.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose near an 11-month high against the and the Australian dollar tumbled after the U.S. said it would slap tariffs on an extra $200 billion of imports from China, sharply escalating tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
The news threw U.S.-China trade war worries back into the spotlight just days after Washington imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing responded immediately with matching tariffs on the same amount of U.S. exports to China.
The offshore Chinese yuan fell as low as 6.6918 per dollar , down more than 0.5 percent from late U.S. levels and edging near its 11-month low of 6.7344 touched on July 3.
The Australian dollar slipped 0.6 percent to $0.7417 from this week's high of $0.7484, which was its highest levels in more than three weeks.
The news also prompted knee-jerk selling of riskier assets against less vulnerable currencies.
The dollar traded at 110.91 yen after dropping to around 110.80 in early Asian trade from around 111.25 in late U.S. trade. It had hit a seven-week high of 111.355 yen earlier on Tuesday.
The slumped 0.6 percent against the yen, changing hands at 82.30 yen.
The yen tends to be bought at times of economic and political stress because Japan's status as the world's largest credit nation suggests any repatriation by Japanese investors were likely to exceed those from Japan by foreign investors.
""With the announcement from the U.S on the Chinese tariffs, the reaction on the policy side from China will be the key event to watch in the coming days,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist for Barclays (LON: ) in Tokyo.
""If China does react with further escalation in tariffs, the U.S. equity market as well as the dollar-yen or Australian dollar could face further downward pressures,"" he said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the United States would impose tariffs of 10 percent on additional Chinese imports worth $200 billion.
The Trump administration released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods it wants to hit with tariffs, including hundreds of food products as well as tobacco, coal, chemicals and tires, dog and cat food, and consumer electronics including television components.
Administration officials said a two-month process would allow the public to comment on the proposed tariffs before the list is finalised.
The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.
""Because Trump talked about the $500 billion figure, it was not a complete surprise. Yet markets will inevitably react to these types of news headlines,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (PA: ).
""Since the new tariffs won't be in place for two months, markets could soon calm down, although we will have to see how share markets, especially Chinese shares, will react to this,"" he said.

Shanghai blue chips ( ) resumed their slide with a fall of 2.3 percent that soured sentiment across the region. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week.
Japan's Nikkei ( ) shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened.
Tension is growing ahead of a July 6 deadline when the U.S. is due to impose US$34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports.
""The key risk for the market isn't that Trump actually implements his trade threats but rather that a protracted period of trade uncertainty begins to weigh on economic activity,"" said analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE: ) in a note.
""The evidence suggesting this is happening is far from conclusive, but ominous data points are accumulating.""
Two surveys of Chinese manufacturing out in the last few days showed a softening in activity, partly due to softness in exports.
A slew of factory readings from across the globe are due on Monday, while the U.S. ISM report is out on Tuesday. Minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting come on Thursday and the week closes with U.S. payrolls for June.
A DEAL, OR NOT?
In currency markets, the euro took an early knock on reports German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had rejected a migration deal German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiated at a European Union summit on Friday.
The currency then partly bounced on news Seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party.
The move makes the future of Merkel's government even more uncertain as her Christian Democrats party (CDU) relies on the CSU to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum.
After all that, the euro was 0.33 percent easier at $0.1642 ( ), having skidded as far as $1.1632 at one stage.
The U.S. dollar gained 0.18 percent on a basket of currencies to 94.808 ( ), but was still below Friday's top of 95.324. It was flat on the yen at 110.68 having been as high as 111.06 at one stage.
The Mexican peso see-sawed after leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory for president.
Dealers said the clear win might settle one source of political uncertainty, but Obrador was also expected to sharpen Mexican divisions with U.S. President Donald Trump.
After an initial retreat, the dollar soon rebounded to be flat at 19.9050 pesos , up from last week's trough around 19.5580.
Trump also loomed large in oil markets with crude taking a spill after he tweeted that Saudi Arabia had agreed to lift oil production by ""maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels"".
The missive was later downplayed by the White House and Saudi Press Agency.
Brent crude ( ) lost 97 cents to $78.26 a barrel, while fell 73 cents to $73.42. The pullback was still modest given U.S. crude rallied more than 8 percent last week, while Brent gained more than 5 percent."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro slipped back in Asian trade on Monday after German Chancellor Angela Merkel was dealt a fresh blow when her interior minister offered to quit in an escalating row over migration policy.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has called for tougher border controls, said he was ready to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU), junior coalition partner in Merkel's government.
While the euro initially rose to as high as $1.1698 in a knee-jerk reaction to the news, it quickly lost steam as Seehofer's departure would be seen as making Merkel's future even more uncertain.
The common currency last stood at $1.1653 ( ), down 0.32 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday. Against the safe-haven Swiss franc, it fell 0.15 percent to 1.1557 franc ( ).
The euro had gained on Friday after European Union leaders hammered out an agreement on migration that investors hoped would ease pressure on Merkel.
The dollar extended its gains against the yen to hit a fresh six-week high of 111.06 yen .
The Japanese currency was unmoved by the Bank of Japan's tankan business sentiment survey, which showed a slight dip in big Japanese manufacturers' sentiment.
The dollar has been supported by the relative strength of the U.S. economy and the prospects of further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Data on Friday showed so-called core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of U.S. inflation, rose 2.0 percent from a year earlier, the biggest gain since April 2012.
That kept alive expectations that the Fed will raise rates at least once and possibly twice by the end of year.
Yet investors are also becoming wary of possible disruptions from the trade disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist ""America First"" policy.
Canada struck back on Friday at the Trump administration over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, imposing punitive measures on C$16.6 billion ($12.63 billion) worth of American goods, effective from Sunday.
The United States has also threatened to impose duties on up to $450 billion of Chinese imports, with the first $34 billion portion set to go into effect on July 6.
While economists expect the direct economic damage from those tariffs to be relatively contained, at least for now, many see the reversal of globalisation could have negative repercussions for years to come, lowering companies' longer-term growth expectations.
Fears of a trade war have already knocked Chinese shares to two-year lows, and dented the yuan last week.
The yuan, which posted its biggest monthly fall on record last month, was not much changed at 6.6460 per dollar in offshore trade, just ahead of Friday's seven-month low of 6.6522 to the dollar.
""The Chinese authorities do not seem to have tried to stem the yuan's fall, which many people take as a message from Beijing that that's one thing they could do against U.S. pressure on trade,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager of State Street Bank.
The official survey on China's manufacturing sector published on Saturday suggested growth in the sector slowed slightly in June after a better-than-expected performance in May.
Elsewhere, the Mexican peso gained as much as 1.4 percent, in choppy early Asian trade on Monday after exit polls showed Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador - widely known as AMLO - scored a decisive win to secure Mexico's presidency on Sunday.
Lopez Obrador, former Mexico City mayor and anti-establishment leftist, rode a wave of voters' anger at rampant violence and corruption in the country.
Investors are now looking to the results of Congressional elections, where National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), a party that has only existed formally since 2014, could be close to a majority.
The peso last traded at 19.8380 to the dollar , up 0.39 percent on the day and edging near one-month high of 19.5615 touched on Friday.
""I think that given the wide lead AMLO had during the whole campaign, a result favorable to him was already priced in the currency,"" said Tania Escobedo, New York-based Latam FX Strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
""So far it seems that the process has been calm and without major disruptions. Signs for a smooth transition and a conciliatory tone from the candidates are also, in our view, adding to Mexican peso strength."""

The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.71% to 94.33.
European Union member states Friday struck a migration deal, agreeing on several measures to tackle the migrant crises in the EU including stepping up border security and setting up holding centers to handle asylum seekers.
The deal was cheered by traders as it eased political uncertainty within the bloc, sending the sharply higher, to $1.1677, up 0.94%.
Ahead of the deal, member states had been in constant disagreement over the handling of migrate crisis: Italy – one of the first port of calls for migrants who manage to survive the trek across the Mediterranean – had threatened to veto any deal if member states did not take ""concrete steps"" to share the influx of migrants.
In German Chancellor Merkel's own backyard, meanwhile, coalition partner, Christian Social Union, had threatened to end the government coalition amid differing views on measures to tackle the migrant crisis.
The rampant euro overshadowed mostly positive U.S. economic data including a report showing U.S. inflation hit the Fed's target, paving the way for the Fed to continue on its rate-hike cycle.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy – in the 12 months through May.
The , a closely-watched indicator by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), rose to a reading of 64.1 in June from 62.7 the prior month, topping economists' estimates for a reading of 60.0.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday, but that was slower than economists had forecast.
But analysts at Stifel downplayed the weakness in consumer spending, citing income growth offered little evidence this was the start of a trend lower in consumer spending, adding that the stronger inflation data would support calls for a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.
""From the Fed’s point of view, stable wages coupled with a further rise in prices offers additional justification for a potentially accelerated pathway for rates,"" Stifel said Friday.

A pumped-up dollar ( ), which has had its best first half in three years, and a 16 percent leap in oil prices ( ) have played a big role too clobbering emerging markets particularly hard.
Argentina's peso and Turkey's lira < > have been shredded 30 and 17 percent, respectively, Chinese stocks have entered bear market territory and EM equities ( ) have slumped 10 percent, or 17 percent excluding a brief January surge.
""People just woke up to the fact that something has changed,"" said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner.
As well as the escalation in global trade tensions ""there has been a realization that the big central banks aren't thinking about stimulating the economy anymore, they are trying to build up capacity in case of recession.""

Still, it hasn't been a doom-fest everywhere.
One Wall Street bellwether, the S&P 500 ( ), is clinging on in positive territory and while the trade jitters have sapped the Dow Jones Industrial ( ), the Nasdaq ( ) has set records this month.
As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: )) are up almost 40 percent despite having $400 billion wiped off their combined value in March when it was revealed Facebook misused 50 million of its users' data.
Netflix has more than doubled in price this year, Amazon (O: ) is up 45 percent and Facebook (O: ) is fully recovered and up over 11 percent. Also, for all the pressure heaped on China in recent months, its tech giant Alibaba (K: ) is up 11 percent.
YUAN TO AVOID?
Among the major currencies, the dollar is up almost 3 percent against the euro ( ) and nearly 2 percent versus the safe-haven yen ( ).
For emerging markets that rise has been a wrecking ball. On top of the ailing lira and peso, Brazil's real is down 14 percent, India's rupee 7 percent, 10 percent and - despite the oil rally - Russia's rouble 9 percent.

Having been the stars of 2017, MSCI's EM equities index ( ) is down 8 percent and local currency and dollar-denominated EM bonds have fallen 6 percent and 5 percent respectively .
What has caused the most concern though has been China.
Stocks there entered a bear market this week having dropped 20 percent from their January peaks, while the yuan < > has just had its worst month on record.
With China the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has also contributed to the respective 9 and 15 percent declines in the price of and zinc , used in things like pipes and galvanized steel.
""What tends to move markets the most tends to be issues with China,"" said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer for Private Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), saying it was both her biggest short-term and longer-term worry.
""These tensions with the U.S. are not going to disappear, they are just going to ebb and flow,"" she said, adding the economy was also imbalanced and had very high debt levels.
Another 2017 high-flier, cryptocurrency Bitcoin ( ), has lost 60 percent, but even traditional safe havens have failed to provide protection over the last few months.
Another two U.S. interest hikes have seen Treasuries ( ) cost holders 3 percent this year and German Bunds ( ) and gold < > are both down 4 percent.
Italy's government bonds meanwhile have plunged 13 percent this quarter as an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its mass bond buying program will end this year.
In contrast to Wall Street and 's solid first halves, euro zone stocks are down too, having lost roughly 6 percent.

On Thursday, amid household debt and Brexit concerns, the pound dived to 1.3055, its weakest level since November 2017.
On Friday, the UK Office for National Statistics released its final reading of British for the first quarter of the year showing 0.2% growth quarter-over-quarter. Analysts had expected sluggish growth of just 0.1%.

The Bank of England predicts growth for the second quarter of 0.4%, the ONS will release Q2 GDP on August 10.
At £17.7 billion ($23.3 billion), the beat forecasts and was at its lowest level in a year.
The revision in Q1 growth is in line with comments from the Bank of England that first quarter data is often subject to revision. The upward revision increases the likelihood that the BoE will raise rates at its August meeting from 50% to 60%.
Dovish comments from incoming BoE policymaker Jonathan Haskel earlier this week hit expectations for an August rate hike as he said there may be more slack than previously thought in the UK economy.
The pound was also lifted on more positive comments coming from the taking place in Brussels.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday that the UK and EU had made progress in Brexit talks and that the pending White Paper from the UK would be ‘valuable and workable’.
The UK’s White Paper on the exit from the European Union is scheduled to be released on the 9 July, following a Cabinet meeting at Chequers on 5 and 6 July.

By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro jumped more than a half cent on Friday after European Union leaders reached an agreement on migration, a thorny issue that has threatened EU unity and the fate of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Still, the is on course to make its first quarterly gain in six while the looks set to post its biggest fall for a month as traders increasingly worry about the impact of Sino-U.S. trade disputes.
""It's a bit strange but the dollar is strong because investors repatriate funds due to worries about trade disputes, with emerging markets hit the hardest,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank.
""It's just a matter of time before this will hit developed markets too,"" he said. ""When markets see real damage from trade friction in economic data, we could see much larger moves,"" he added.
The euro rose as high as $1.1650 ( ), extending its recovery from the one-week low of $1.15275 touched on Thursday, after EU leaders reached the deal on migration.
If unresolved, the row would have sent a damaging signal about EU unity at a time when the bloc is being assailed by U.S. President Donald Trump on trade and struggling to deal with the legacy of its 2015 crisis, which saw more than one million refugees and migrants enter Europe.
It would have been especially dangerous for Merkel, the EU's longest serving leader, who came under intense pressure from her conservative allies in Bavaria to deliver a deal on migration in Brussels.
The deal improved risk sentiment, undermining the yen while lifting growth-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
The yen fell 0.25 percent to 110.75 to the dollar while Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.7376.
TRADE WAR FEARS
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies ( ) ( ) stood down 0.5 percent at 94.936 after having risen to as high as 95.534 on Thursday, a level last seen almost a year ago.
Despite Friday's drop, the index was up 5.5 percent this quarter, its first rise since the final quarter of 2016.
The dollar's gains partly stemmed from the prospects of rising U.S. interest rates on the back of solid expansion in the U.S. economy.
During the past week, the greenback was helped by repatriations ahead of the end of quarter and a half year.
But its overall strength, especially against many emerging currencies, is likely to reflect repatriation on increasing worries about U.S. trade disputes, some traders also said.
One notable currency that has weakened against the dollar is China's yuan , which fell to a 7 1/2-month low of 6.6441 on Friday.
It has lost 3.5 percent this month, surpassing the 2.7 percent fall seen in August 2015, when Beijing shocked markets by unexpectedly guiding the yuan sharply lower.
""We have Chinese economic data coming up tomorrow, one of the first readings after trade tensions have escalated. Chinese PMIs have been essentially flat for some time but if it shows a major deterioration, that could worsen sentiment,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (PA: ), referring to the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index due on Saturday.
Caution about a further fall in the yuan was palpable in the options market."

(Bloomberg) -- One long-time dollar bull says the greenback’s charge is just getting started. He just can’t find any clients who agree.
David Woo, head of global rates and foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America , is pounding the table that the dollar’s more than 6 percent rally since mid-April will intensify whether trade tensions dissipate or ratchet higher.
""I’ve never been this bullish the U.S. economy in 20 years I’ve been doing this,"" the strategist said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio, citing the effects of the tax overhaul on corporate behavior. ""That’s the fundamental story here, which is that this economy is growing gangbusters and the market remains in denial.""
His preferred way to express a dollar bias is relative to the .
Should trade tensions intensify, European and emerging market economies will bear the brunt of the damage, and those currencies will fall relative to the greenback, he argued. If not, ""this economy is going to go crazy and I’m telling you the dollar is going to surge because we’re going to see a massive repricing of the federal funds rate,"" said Woo.
Indeed, market proxies for how much the U.S. central bank will increase rates during this tightening cycle have ebbed somewhat in recent weeks.
Woo’s take on positioning and sentiment informs his stance on the world’s reserve currency.
Visiting clients on the West Coast, he said he couldn’t find a single one that was long the dollar -- even amid its tear.
Macro tourists, or as Woo calls them cross-over investors, have not aggressively pared their exposure to emerging markets even as those currencies have come under pressure, perhaps due to a dearth of liquidity.
""This also leads me to think that there’s no question this dollar rally is going to keep going,"" he said. ""If you earn 3 percent buying JPMorgan paper, why the hell would you want to buy Brazil at 6 percent?""
If roughly 10 to 20 percent of those crossover investors exited their positions, there would be ""a shockwave through emerging markets,"" said Woo.
As if this wasn’t bad enough, check out this chart:
Meanwhile, China’s need for easier monetary conditions amid a softening economy, ongoing deleveraging campaign, and less supportive global growth backdrop means Beijing has ""a gun pointed at their head"" and no choice but to let their currency decline, he added."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was steady against its peers on Thursday, having failed to extend overnight gains amid conflicting signals from Washington on a proposal to restrict Chinese investment as the bitter U.S.-China trade row kept financial markets on edge.

The ( ) against a basket of six major currencies stood steady at 95.266 after rallying 0.65 percent the previous day.
The greenback had advanced after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he will use a strengthened national security review process to thwart Chinese acquisitions of sensitive American technologies, a softer approach than imposing China-specific investment restrictions.
There was, however, some confusion about Washington's intentions - with U.S. shares making an about-turn and dropping - after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network later on Wednesday that Trump's announced plan did not indicate a softened stance on China.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had favored a more measured and global approach to protecting U.S. technology, using authority approved by Congress, while White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, the administration's harshest China critic, had argued for China-specific restrictions.
""The dollar has managed to stay buoyant despite a drop in Treasury yields and risk-off in U.S. stocks due to half year-end flows, which involves U.S. investors buying back the dollar,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""It remains to be seen how long flow-driven bids can support the dollar. Headlines on trade issues will continue to dictate direction once such flows subside.""
The dollar was flat at 110.23 yen . The currency rose to 110.49 the previous day before pulling back slightly following Kudlow's comments on Trump's investment restriction plans.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1567 ( ) after shedding 0.8 percent overnight. Concerns over political complications in Germany are expected to be a drag on the single currency.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's fragile coalition government faces potential collapse as the Christian Social Union (CSU), her Bavarian ally, has threatened to defy her and impose border controls unless their demands to reduce Germany's immigration burden are met.
At the European Council Summit later on Thursday, Merkel will try to secure agreements on immigration on a continental level to appease the CSU.
""The odds are seemingly against Merkel obtaining a meaningful solution and the euro looks set to suffer further declines depending on the headlines coming out of the summit,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a two-week low against the yen on Monday as a latest flare-up in global trade concerns dented investor risk appetites and drove down U.S. yields.
The greenback was down 0.4 percent at 109.54 yen after dropping to 109.45, its weakest since June 11.
Investors steered from risk, with Asian equities in retreat and Treasury yields declining, after the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Treasury Department is crafting rules that would block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies involved in ""industrially significant technology"".
The report added to the sense of caution felt after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 20 percent tariff on all cars imported from the European Union. The EU responded by saying it will have no choice but to retaliate to such a move.
""The dollar was already looking shaky against the yen in wake of the U.S. spat with the EU. Any positive breakthrough in trade talks would prompt bargain hunting of the dollar, but that is simply not happening,"" said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale (PA: ) in Tokyo.
""Even if the batch of U.S. data due this week prove to be strong, the dollar may not draw much support as long as trade worries are not cleared.""
This week's U.S. indicators include housing-related data on Monday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index on Tuesday, durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) numbers on Friday.

The greenback had climbed to the 11-month peak as higher U.S. yields underlined the divergence in monetary policies between the United States and Europe.
The dollar, however, began to sag toward the end of last week as U.S. yields lost their lift amid heightened trade tensions between Washington and the European Union. The 10-year Treasury note yield ( ) fell to a one-week low of 2.871 percent on Monday.
The euro was steady at $1.1654 ( ) after gaining about 0.5 percent on Friday. The single currency was lifted after Friday's upbeat German and French business activity data and fresh assurances by Italian politicians that their nation would not leave the single currency.
""The euro is on a technical bounce but whether it can retain the uptrend depends on how the US-EU trade tensions pan out,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""The trade spat has helped drive down both U.S. and German debt yields, and both the euro and dollar could lose out if tensions intensify,"" he said. ""The yen could end up the winner in such a case by attracting safety bids.""
Commodity-linked currencies dipped as a surge by prices ran out of steam amid the latest round of trade jitters.
Oil had rallied on Friday after OPEC agreed to an unexpectedly modest increase in production from next month after Saudi Arabia persuaded Iran to cooperate.
The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at $0.7418 after gaining 0.85 percent on Friday. The had fallen to a one-year low of $0.7394 last week, hurt by the Sino-U.S. trade spat.
The Canadian dollar slipped 0.25 percent to C$1.3295 per dollar after advancing 0.4 percent on Friday. The had brushed a one-year low of C$1.3384 last week, buffeted by volatility in crude oil prices.
The Turkish lira was up about 0.5 percent at 4.64 per dollar, after jumping as much as 1.6 percent earlier.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell off an 11-month high on Thursday against a basket of major currencies as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's gauge of U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell to a near 1-1/2 year low, spurring profit-taking on the greenback.
The euro recovered from its weakest level since July 2017 which was tied to bets on a protracted period of monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and European central banks.
The single currency was also pressured earlier after the Italian government appointed two eurosceptics to head key finance committees, reigniting worries about anti-euro voices in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
""Philly Fed missed on the downside. That was a convenient excuse for traders to take profits,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst with Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The Philadelphia Fed said its barometer on U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity fell from 34.4 in May to 19.9 in June, its lowest since November 2016.
The index's sharpest drop since January 2014 came amid escalation in a U.S.-China trade conflict, which has underpinned safe-haven support for the dollar in recent days.
""It does loom as a potential headwind for the U.S. and global economy,"" Manimbo said of the rising trade tensions.
The world's top central bankers at a conference in Sintra, Portugal on Wednesday acknowledged that a serious dispute with more tariffs would weaken their economic outlook, although they have not altered their policy stance for now.
At 10:25 a.m. (1425 GMT), an index that tracks the dollar against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies ( ) slipped 0.1 percent to 94.926 after touching 95.529 earlier Thursday, which was its highest since mid-July 2017.
The euro rebounded from an 11-month low to $1.1592 ( ), while the greenback decreased 0.4 percent to 110.93 yen .
Elsewhere, sterling rose over 0.5 percent at $1.3243, recovering from a seven-month trough after the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, unexpectedly joined those calling for rates to rise to 0.75 percent, citing concerns about growing wage pressure.
Haldane's vote, however, was not enough to flip the BOE's decision to leave key borrowing costs at 0.5 percent.
Meanwhile, even as the Swiss National Bank as expected clung to its negative interest rate policy, the Swiss currency rose against the euro ( ) to 1.1499 franc as some traders saw a slightly more hawkish tone from the central bank.
Norway's central bank also kept rates on hold but said it was on track to raise rates in September, sending the Norwegian crown to an eight-month peak versus the euro ( ) at 9.3900.

LONDON (Reuters) - Simmering trade and political tensions and a pumped-up dollar weighed on world shares on Thursday, while oil prices were under pressure before an OPEC meeting expected to increase the world's supply of crude.
Europe's main stock markets ( ) were back near two-month lows and Wall Street's S&P 500 ( ) and Dow Jones ( ) ( ) started lower, as the jitters that have dominated markets for months overshadowed a new record high for the Nasdaq. ( )[.EU]
A whip-sawing dollar also caused confusion. It had roared to an 11-month peak during European trading only to fall back in opening U.S. deals despite another drop in jobless claims figures.
Europe's big move was a 3 percent drop in car shares ( ) to nine-month lows, after Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler (DE: ) warned the global trade tensions were slowing its sales.
Italian stocks and bonds also suffered as two eurosceptics were given key parliamentary finance roles by the country's new coalition government.[.EU][GVD/EUR].
""The reaction of the dollar has been very interesting this week,"" said State Street Global Markets head of macro strategy Michael Metcalfe.
""In previous periods this year, fears of a trade war have been dollar-negative, but that has been different this week ... we have had this potential escalation in the trade war, and it has rallied.""
Asia had been mixed, too, with Japan's Nikkei ( ) adding 0.6 percent and Australia's main index ( ) enjoying another strong day before the end of its financial year next week.
China however finished more than 1 percent lower and at 2 year closing lows due to the trade strains ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ). MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ( ) ended down too have been 0.5 percent higher at one point.
Gyrations were compounded by the dollar's surge to an 11-month high [FRX/]. That raises inflation outside the U.S. and puts pressure on any country or company that has gorged itself on dollar-denominated debt.
The mere absence of new trade threats from U.S President Donald Trump on tariffs was nevertheless enough to keep hopes alive that all the bluster was a ploy which would stop short of an outright trade war.
Markets had also been encouraged by the People's Bank of China's move to set firm fixings for its yuan, along with the addition of extra liquidity, though the spot yuan rate did hit a fresh five-month low.
There was also much speculation the central bank would cut bank reserve requirements, thus boosting lending power in the economy.
Wall Street was clearly still harboring worries about trade as it opened. The 30-member Dow Jones which includes Caterpillar (N: ) and Boeing (N: ) both with big Chinese revenues, will rack up an eighth straight session of losses if it ends in the red.
And even though there was nothing directly from Trump, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did give a CNBC interview.
""What we have to do is create an environment where it's more painful for these parties that have these huge trade barriers,"" Ross said.
POUND REBOUND
The dollar's swings made for a busy day for currency markets. It hopped between 110.76 and 110.20 yen , hit an 11-month high against a basket of top currencies before losing steam and briefly sent the euro ( ) below $1.15 again.
Sterling had hit a seven-month low only to jump back up to $1.32 after the Bank of England's chief economist unexpectedly joined a minority of the Bank's policymakers calling for an interest rate hike at its latest meeting.
It wasn't enough to stop the BoE keeping everything on hold but it did revive talk of an August rate rise.
While the European Central Bank has signaled an end to bond-buying, it has pledged to keep euro zone rates low past next summer, and the Bank of Japan shows no sign of unwinding its stimulus.
Switzerland's central bank kept its rates deep in negative territory on Thursday and warned that risks to the economy were rising amid all the trade war noise.
""It feels like the yellow warning lights are flashing for the global economic system,"" noted analysts at Citi.
""However, with the ECB and BoJ still pumping in liquidity and keeping rates lower for longer, the chances of a systemic event are low.""
That low-risk market mood nudged gold to a six-month low.
Oil was also on the slide ahead of Friday's meeting of producers in Vienna, where Saudi Arabia is trying to convince fellow OPEC members of the need to pump more oil, according to sources familiar with the talks.
""We need to release supply to the market,"" Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters. Iran on Thursday also signaled it could be won over to a small rise in output, potentially paving the way for a deal.
Benchmark Brent crude ( ) fell $1.56 a barrel to a low of $73.18 before recovering slightly to $73.34, down $1.40, by 0850 GMT. U.S. light crude ( ) was $1.00 lower at $64.71.

EURO UNDER PRESSURE
China's commerce ministry responded on Tuesday by saying Beijing would fight back firmly with ""qualitative"" and ""quantitative"" measures if the United States publishes additional tariffs.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The euro on Friday was headed for its worst weekly loss in 19 months after a cautious European Central Bank signaled it will keep interest rates at record lows well into next year.
Following a closely-watched meeting on Thursday, the ECB said it will end its massive bond purchase scheme by the end of this year, taking its biggest step towards dismantling crisis-era stimulus.
The euro briefly spiked to a one-month high of $1.1853 ( ) following the announcement.
But euro bulls were soon in retreat as the ECB also indicated that it would keep interest rates steady at least through the summer of 2019, reflecting the uncertainties hanging over the euro zone economy.
Euro bulls had been emboldened earlier this month as expectations grew for the ECB to begin raising rates at an earlier juncture in 2019, after comments by policymakers such as ECB chief economist Peter Praet, who struck a hawkish tone despite recent political troubles in Italy.
The single currency slumped nearly 1.9 percent on Thursday, its largest one-day fall since Britain's June 2016 Brexit vote shock.
It stretched overnight losses to brush $1.1555, lowest since May 30. The currency was down 1.72 percent on the week, positioning it to have its biggest weekly loss since November 2016.
""The euro showed such a big reaction to the ECB meeting as its stance came in sharp contrast to the Federal Reserve, which had struck a hawkish tone just the day before,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rates for the second time this year and indicated that it could tighten policy two more times in 2018.
""Instead of reacting immediately to the Fed, many in the market had opted to first see out the ECB meeting, considered the main event of the week. And they duly reacted,"" Ishikawa said.
The euro was a shade higher at 128.035 yen ( ) after dropping 1.7 percent overnight.
The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 110.720 yen after rising 0.25 percent the previous day.
The greenback was up roughly 1 percent versus its Japanese peer on the week, during which it brushed a three-week peak of 110.850 after the Fed's Wednesday policy announcement.
The currency pair, sensitive to shifts in risk appetite in the broader markets, could be impacted by developments later on Friday in the U.S.-China trade spat.
U.S. President Donald Trump is due to unveil revisions to his initial tariff list targeting $50 billion of Chinese goods, and focus was on whether the revisions would ease or further fuel trade tensions.
""The tariff revision is a risk event the market is bracing for, with the United States potentially getting even more active on trade issues ahead of Mexico's elections in July,"" said Shusuke Yamada, currency and equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) in Tokyo.
Mexico holds a presidential election on July 1 at a time when relations with its northern neighbor are frosty.
""The bottom line for currencies, however, is that the Fed is hawkish and the ECB is not, and monetary policy diversion remains the primary driver,"" Yamada said.
The yen's reaction to the Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on monetary policy on Friday was limited, as such an outcome had been well anticipated.
The BOJ offered a weaker view on inflation than in April, signaling that it will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus program.
Against a broadly stronger dollar, the Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7458 after slipping to a one-month trough of $0.7454 .

(Bloomberg) -- Currency traders looking to Jerome Powell and Mario Draghi for direction are getting the clearest signals yet that the dollar is set to extend its gains versus the euro.
That bet is being fueled by a divergence between the Federal Reserve chairman’s hawkish stance Wednesday and the European Central Bank president’s dovish posture Thursday. The disparate policy paths and contrasting fundamental trends in the U.S. and Europe are setting up a test of the key $1.15 level for the euro-dollar exchange rate in the weeks ahead, according to strategists at Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) & Co. and ABN Amro Group NV.
The greenback has “a little room to run” still, said Kathy Jones, New York-based chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “We have seen softer numbers out of Europe and firmer numbers out of the U.S.”
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose as much as 0.7 percent Thursday to its highest since November after the ECB pledged to keep interest rates unchanged at current record lows at least through the summer of 2019, even as it phases out bond purchases by the end of the year. The move comes a day after the Fed raised interest rates, ratcheted up rate projections for 2018 and 2019 and sounded an optimistic note on the U.S. economy. The greenback has risen 2 percent this year, rebounding after an almost 9 percent loss in 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks jumped more than 1 percent on Thursday, while the euro cratered against the dollar, after the European Central Bank indicated it would not raise interest rates through the summer of 2019.
The bank's unexpectedly dovish guidance on interest rates overshadowed its statement that it aimed to wrap up its crisis-era stimulus program, quantitative easing, at the end of this year.
The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the governing council stood ready ""to adjust all its instruments as appropriate.""
Investors, though, seized on comments indicating that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019.
Some analysts believe it could be even longer.
""With Draghi's term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton.
Ten-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, fell around four basis points to 0.43 percent ( ).
The euro, meanwhile, touched on its steepest one-day drop against the U.S. dollar since June of 2016, while the dollar accelerated to a two-week peak.
The euro ( ) was last down 1.37 percent to $1.1628, while the , which measures the greenback against six top currencies, ( ) rose 0.85 percent.
EQUITIES STRONG
European equities rose sharply after initial losses, with Wall Street creeping into positive territory.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ( ) rose 1.40 percent, buoyed by big gains in interest rate-sensitive sectors like autos and utilities.
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the ( ) meeting and, given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas. ""It doesn't seem like we're at the stage where the hawks are on top of things.""

TRADE TENSIONS
One issue keeping investors in check was concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to meet with trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.
CBOT corn and soybean futures were down sharply as uncertainty about tariffs and favorable crop weather in the U.S. Midwest have prompted funds to liquidate big long positions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields tumbled and the euro headed for its biggest daily loss versus the dollar in eight months on Thursday after the European Central Bank indicated it would not be raising interest rates through the summer of 2019.
The bank's unexpectedly dovish guidance on interest rates overshadowed, at least for the time being, its statement that it aimed to wrap up its stimulus program at the end of this year -- marking the biggest step in dismantling crisis-era stimulus -- quantitative easing.
The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the governing council stood ready ""to adjust all its instruments as appropriate"".
However, investors seized on comments indicating that the end of QE would not be followed by rapid policy tightening, and that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019.
Some market players now reckon rates may not rise even in the months immediately after next summer, noting that Draghi's tenure at the ECB would end in October 2019.
""Although we now know that QE is scheduled to end under Draghi’s watch, we think the ECB could wait a little longer before starting to raise interest rates,"" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton.
""With Draghi's term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place.""
The single currency ( ) is currently on track for its biggest one-day loss since October against the dollar, while it also fell one percent to the yen and half a percent to the Swiss franc ( ) ( ).
Bond investors, meanwhile, drew comfort from the dovish interest rate outlook, with 10-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, falling around four basis points to 0.44 percent ( ).
Analysts also noted that there were no changes to the ECB's plan to reinvest funds from maturing bonds, providing a layer of support for bonds markets even as the central bank winds down QE.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Bond yields from Italy, the country seen as the most vulnerable to higher borrowing costs, also fell, with short-dated yields down 7 basis points at 0.89 percent ( ), having been 9 bps higher shortly before the ECB statement.
Italian 10-year yields were down around 2 bps at 2.80 percent ( ).
Draghi noted that volatility in Italy had ebbed in the past two weeks but revised down economic growth forecasts for the euro zone for 2018, while noting that inflation, after accounting for higher oil prices, remained muted
Karen Ward, chief market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Asset Management, said the move to end QE by end-year as previously signaled was significant in light of the recent Italian mini-crisis that saw bond yields there soar to multi-year highs.
""Stepping back from QE will insulate the ECB from potential criticism that it is funding the fiscal largesse associated with certain populist policies.""
But the ECB stance has surprised markets, partly because ECB policymakers such as chief economist Peter Praet, have in recent weeks indicated the central bank remained undeterred by events Italy or economic data indicating a slowdown in euro zone growth momentum.
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said Arne Petimezas, an analyst at AFS Group, an Amsterdam-based brokerage.
Money market pricing accordingly reflected a scaling ack of rate-hike bets over the next year.
Investors now price less than a 30 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate hike in June 2019, compared with a roughly 80 percent chance before the ECB announcement .
On equity markets, an index of euro zone stocks - which benefit from a weaker euro - jumped 0.8 percent ( ) to a 2 1/2 week high, having languished in negative territory before the announcement.
The biggest beneficiaries were interest-rate sensitive sectors such as autos ( ) which rose 1.8 percent, while shares in utilities rose 0.6 percent ( ).
Bank stocks, which tend to gain from higher interest rates, fell 0.5 percent on the day ( ) but JPM's Ward played down that move.
""If low interest rates support the health of the economy – not least via a weaker exchange rate – then that will help demand for lending and volume bank lending,"" she said.

Investing.com - The euro dropped on Thursday after the signaled plans to wind up its bond purchasing program stimulus program by the end of the year but reiterated that it expects to keep interest rates on hold until the middle of 2019.
The euro initially spiked to the days highs, with rising to 1.1852, the most since May 16, before reversing gains to trade at 1.1667 by 09:19 AM ET (13:19 GMT).
The ECB said that it anticipates its asset purchase program will end in December 2018 after halving to €15 billion per month from September 2018, down from €30 billion at present.
The euro came under pressure after the ECB also pledged to keep interest rates unchanged until at least the middle of next year.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with the current expectations of a sustained adjustment path,"" the ECB said.
The single currency came under additional selling pressure after ECB President Mario Draghi reiterated that the central bank stands ready to ramp up stimulus as needed.
Economic growth in the euro zone economy is solid, Draghi said but he noted that it has moderated due to temporary factors, such as weaker trade and pointed to rising protectionism as a particular risk.
The ECB cut its forecast for growth this year, saying it now expects euro zone GDP to increase by 2.1%, down from 2.4% in March.
It raised its inflation forecast for this year, saying it now expects consumer prices to rise by 1.7%, up from 1.4% previously.
The euro was also lower against the yen and the pound, with losing 0.95% to trade at 128.92 and down 0.49% to 0.8773.
The , which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.67% to 94.19, the most since June 5, boosted by the weaker euro.
The ECB announcement came a day after a more hawkish sounding raised interest rates for the second time this year and indicated that it now sees two more rate increases before the years end.
The Fed described the U.S. jobs market as “strong” and said economic activity had been rising at “a solid rate”."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slumped more than half a percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would keep interest rates at record lows through the summer of 2019 and signaled it would end its unprecedented bond purchase scheme by end-2018.
After initially rallying nearly half a percent higher to $1.1853, the single currency ( ) fell to the day's lows at $1.1718 -- marking an intraday range of one percent as some analysts were disappointed about the timing of its rate hike.
Investors now price just a 30 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate hike by July 2019, compared with a roughly 80 percent chance earlier in the day.
""The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas based in Amsterdam.
Signaling the move would not mean rapid policy tightening in the coming months, the ECB also said that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019, suggesting protracted support for the economy, even if at a lower level.
""It doesn't seem like we're at the stage where the hawks are on top of things.""
The euro's drop pulled the dollar higher with the index up 0.1 percent on the day ( ) at 93.81.
In the London session, the dollar was trading broadly weaker before the ECB decision in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes, with future rate rises now priced in with a growing view that U.S. economic strength could be nearing its peak, analysts said.
As expected, the Fed lifted its key overnight borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point for a second time this year, to between 1.75 and 2.00 percent."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was weaker against the euro but rose against some emerging market currencies and hit a three-week high against the yen on Wednesday as investors braced for what is expected to be the Federal Reserve's second interest rate increase of 2018.
The euro gained ground on the greenback amid expectations that the European Central Bank on Thursday would signal its intention to taper its 2.55 trillion euro ($3 trillion) bond purchasing program later in 2018.
Some emerging market currencies weakened versus the dollar on the possibility of a Fed rate hike, while others rose. Countries like Turkey with large external financing needs are particularly vulnerable to rising dollar-funding costs.
The U.S. central bank is due to release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), followed by a press conference half an hour later by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares edged slightly lower on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve policy decision and any clues it might give on future rate hikes, shifting focus away from the historic U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) dipped 0.15 percent in early trade, giving up the slim gains they made following Tuesday's meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Japan's Nikkei ( ) eked out gains of 0.10 percent.

With the U.S.-North Korea summit out of the way, market focus is quickly shifting to the Fed's two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday.

""With a rate hike almost fully priced in, the focus is on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year and next and how much beyond the levels it considers as neutral to the economy, or what they call the longer-run rates,"" said HSBC's Shirota.
Projections from the Fed's March meeting suggest a benchmark rate of 2.1 percent at end of 2018, based on the median forecast of central bank policymakers, which would mean three rate hikes in total this year.
In the currency market, the dollar was relatively well bid ahead of the Fed's meeting.
The euro traded at $1.1744 ( ), off last week's high of $1.1840 touched on June 7 though it was underpinned by expectations that the European Central Bank may drop a hint of winding up its stimulus after its policy meeting on Thursday.

By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar gave up all its earlier gains on Tuesday, as markets saw few concrete measures emerging from the U.S.-North Korea summit and waited for guidance from two of the world's top central banks this week.
With most currencies staying within well-trodden trading ranges before U.S. inflation data due shortly, the Norwegian kroner was the surprise winner in the London session as a survey by Norway's central bank painted a rosy outlook for the economy.
""There is very little to take away from the summit and the markets will be focused on the Fed's forward guidance,"" said Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole (PA: ) in London.
U.S. inflation data for May is expected to show a modest rise in price pressures, with the headline rate tipped to rise to 2.7 percent on an annual basis, according to a Reuters poll, versus 2.5 percent previously. The data is due at 1230 GMT.
Against a basket of rivals ( ), the dollar was flat on the day at 93.60 after bouncing 0.3 percent to 93.89 in early trading in Asia, its highest since June 5.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he had formed a ""very special bond"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a meeting, but the Korean stock and currency markets were broadly flat and U.S. debt, which tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty, held steady.
""This is more of a side show and headline grabber rather than yielding anything substantive with markets more worried about the developments at the G7 summit,"" said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING in London, referring to trade tensions among the world's largest economies.
Against the Japanese yen , the dollar was trading a quarter of a percent higher at 110.32 yen, its highest in nearly three weeks and above a 200-day moving average.
SHINING CROWN
The Norwegian crown jumped after a central bank survey indicated Norwegian companies are expecting the pace of output growth to accelerate in the next half year, painting a relatively robust outlook for the domestic economy.
Norges Bank's regional network business survey, a key component in rate decisions and interest rate forecasts is followed by a central bank meeting next week.
The crown ( ) strengthened against the euro to a seven-month high of 9.4272, up 0.4 percent on the day.
Currency markets had a slightly more risk-on mode with perceived safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc weaker on the day, while relatively high yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar posting modest gains.
Of more importance to global markets will be any clarity on the outlook for U.S. and European monetary policy this week at a time when policymakers have stuck to optimistic stances despite the tensions over global trade.
The U.S. Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting starting on June 12, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year. The focus is on whether the central bank will hint at raising rates a total of four times in 2018.
The European Central Bank also meets on June 14, when it could signal intentions to start unwinding its massive bond purchasing program.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Tuesday and the dollar retreated from a three-week high after a U.S.-North Korea summit aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Washington committed to providing security guarantees for its old enemy.

Investors had mixed reactions to the summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved.
""Any de-escalation is good, because in the background you always have worries about these situations,"" said Old Mutual Global Investors European fund manager Ian Ormiston, adding trade conversations over the weekend at the G7 summit were more concerning.
Others, such as RBC Capital Markets' head of Asia FX strategy Sue Trinh said there was ""nothing particularly game-changing"" about the summit and both sides stood far apart on what denuclearization means.
""To the U.S., it means North Korea must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. To Kim, it means North Korea suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the U.S. stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region.""
In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan's Nikkei ( ) paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent.

FOCUS SHIFTS TO CENTRAL BANKS
Investor focus was shifting to the two major central bank meetings later this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year.
Futures contracts indicate a 96 percent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, according to CME Group (NASDAQ: ).
Investors are focused on how the U.S. central bank characterizes its monetary policy as borrowing costs return to normal amid an economic expansion. The Fed may signal whether it feels the era of loose money is, in effect, over.
U.S. inflation data due later in the day will also add to speculation over the path for U.S. interest rates later this year. Markets now are pricing in slightly more than one chance in five rates will be raised for a fourth time this year.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets, and some expect the Bank to provide guidance for an ending of its bond-buying program at the end of this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose to a near two-week high on Monday after assurances from Italy that it would not leave the European Union calmed investors' nerves before a key European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting.
Italy's economy minister said on Sunday his new coalition government would not leave the euro or issue securities to pay off companies owed money by the state, a plan investors viewed as a first step toward exiting the bloc.
That sent Italian borrowing costs down sharply on Monday as the euro rallied half a percent to $1.1816 ( ) toward a two-week high of $1.1840 touched on Thursday.
""The Italy comments calmed fears but let's wait for the government's policy actions this summer. That will decide the market's direction,"" said MUFG currency strategist Lee Hardman.
Investors are raising their bets that the ECB will signal at a policy meeting on Thursday a winding down of its vast bond-buying program by the end of 2018, following a flurry of hawkish comments by officials last week.
The euro bounced despite heightened worries about a global trade war following a spat at the Group of Seven summit in Canada between U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders over automobile tariffs and other issues.
Trumped lashed out at Canada and Europe over the U.S. trade deficit after he arrived in Singapore, where he is due to hold an historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday.
The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, which has been dogged by fears that Trump may scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), both fell 0.6 percent.
Analysts said that the fairly muted reaction in currencies reflected the low expectations markets had for the G7 summit, despite the fact that the euro is sensitive to the threat of U.S. tariffs on cars.
""The overhang of global trade wars is still very much alive but the global FX price action this week will be driven by a stream of other key events,"" said Viraj Patel, a currencies analyst at ING.
Investors are ready for more volatility before a confluence of big events this week, including the Trump-Kim summit, policy reviews by the world's three major central banks, and a UK parliamentary Brexit bill vote. (For a Factbox, see)
Easing Italian political concerns and speculation the ECB will announce on June 14 when it will unwind its bond purchasing program put the dollar under pressure last week as the euro bounced back from 10-month lows.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks climbed on Monday, shrugging off the weekend's fractious G7 summit as investors looked forward to a week packed with diplomatic, policy and political events while reassuring comments from Italy pushed the euro up.
A summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday will be followed by meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank plus a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament.
But risky assets were well supported on Monday as comments from Italy's new coalition government saying it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt levels pushed Italian stocks ( ) up more than 2 percent and a wider gauge of European stocks up 0.6 percent.
""Markets are focused on the headlines from Italy and that has calmed investors as they believe the threat of confrontation with the EU has dropped significantly,"" said Mike Bell, a global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London.
U.S. stock index futures ( ) were flat after dropping as much as 0.3 percent in early trading, indicating a cautious start for Wall Street. The MSCI world equity index ( ), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent.
With no top level U.S. economic data due for release on Monday, all eyes are on the summit in Singapore and the Fed, which is almost certain to raise interest rates on Wednesday.
Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria soothed investors' nerves on Sunday. In his first interview since taking office a week ago, Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that the new coalition was committed to remaining within the single currency and wanted to boost growth through investment and structural reforms.
Bond yields tumbled by 25-50 basis points across the board in Italy while the euro firmed, nearing a recent three-week high.
The single currency ( ) rose nearly half a percent to $1.1821 in early trading before trimming some gains to stand 0.2 percent up on the day.
Trump's rejection of a previously signed G7 communique separates the United States from its traditional global economic allies and underlines trade tensions.
However, it had little impact on global markets with investors taking the news in their stride in a week when the world's top central banks - the Fed and the ECB - are set to tighten policy.
""Though the latest headlines are definitely not positive for global trade, risk appetite is broadly firm across the board as investors are of the view it might force the ECB and the Fed to take a cautious approach,"" said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London.
G7 ""MESS""
Stocks wobbled and the dollar edged higher in initial reaction to the G7, which Societe Generale (PA: ) termed as a ""mess"". However, markets quickly recouped losses, with stocks firmer across the board on expectations that any withdrawal in policy stimulus would be very gradual against the backdrop of the rising trade tensions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares stepped back from a 2-1/2 month high on Friday as risk appetite soured on bets that Europe's massive monetary stimulus was nearing an end, compounded by uncertainty over trade relations ahead of a key meeting of global leaders.

""Markets are having to rediscover how to price risk amid reduced central bank buying and that adjustment could prove very hard,"" said Matt King, Citi's global head of credit strategy.
Another major reason for the nerves was the widening rift between the United States and its major trade partners after President Donald Trump imposed import tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week.
Trump seemed in no mood to reconcile when he tweeted, just one day before a Group of Seven summit, that France and Canada imposed ""massive tariffs"" on their imports from the United States and had non-monetary barriers to trade.

By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro and bond yields rose on Thursday as investors priced in an early wind-down of European Central Bank stimulus, while renewed risk appetite drove world stocks to a 3-1/2 week high.
The selloff in safe-haven Bunds and U.S. Treasuries drove money into riskier assets, especially financial stocks, despite investor anxiety over how a G7 leaders summit that kicks off on Friday will pan out in view of divisions over global trade.
Bank stocks, which tend to gain from higher bond yields, drove European shares up. The pan-European banks index ( ) jumped 0.5 percent, supporting the STOXX 600 ( ).
Banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date, however, having been dented by political risk in Italy.
MSCI's index of world stocks ( ) rose 0.2 percent to its highest since May 14.
Wall Street was also set for a positive open with Jones and futures up 0.1 to 0.2 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ), however, was set for a dip from its record high.
In Europe the single currency ( ) hit its highest level since May 15 at $1.1838, and traded up 0.4 percent at $1.1815 in its fourth straight session of gains. It helped drive the ( ) down 0.4 percent to 93.295.
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose in step with the euro, breaching 0.50 percent for the first time in two weeks on signs that the European Central Bank could soon call an end to its stimulus program.
The selloff in German Bunds spread across the Atlantic as the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield ( ) hit a 2-1/2 week high of 2.9940 percent, edging closer to the 3 percent level it breached a month ago.
The ECB's Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made the bank increasingly confident inflation was on its way back to target, raising chances it may reveal more about the end of the bond-buying program at next week's meeting.
Praet's comments took the market by surprise, given a recent slowdown in the euro zone economy.
Data on Thursday showed German industrial orders plunged unexpectedly in April, a fourth consecutive monthly drop.
""It's a complex backdrop where ultimately the economy is not doing badly, but the economic surprises in Europe have not been to the upside,"" said Antoine Lesne, head of EMEA strategy and research at State Street's SPDR ETF.
""Bad momentum has eased the overall backdrop the ECB is navigating - but if you're looking at the broader macro picture it is still positive for risk assets.""
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ) said Praet's speech showed the central bank was willing to look through the recent soft patch in euro zone data.
TOO BULLISH?
The risk-on moves across markets coincided with a calendar of potentially destabilizing political events.
The run-up to the G7 summit has been dominated by a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Trump and the club's remaining six members.
But gauges of investor anxiety, including stock volatility, showed little sign of strain, flummoxing some investors.
The VIX, which measures volatility on the S&P 500 ( ), was last trading at 11.79. It has fallen from more than 50 to less than 12 in just 83 days - a record decline, traders said.
""I am amazed to see everyone so bullish,"" said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at Societe Generale (PA: ).
""Everyone assumes that ...central banks will be behind the curve by default, but it's not that obvious.""
Commodities continued to climb thanks to a still strong global economy and tight supply.
hit its highest level this year at $7,295 per tonne, driven up as much as 0.8 percent by supply concerns over disruption at the Escondida mine in Chile. It was on track for its sixth straight day of gains, its longest run since December.
Oil prices also rose as plunging exports from OPEC member Venezuela crimped supply in the market.
Brent crude futures ( ) traded up 1.4 percent at $76.46 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ( ) up 1 percent at $65.39.
Gold prices edged higher, with trading at $1,298.75 per ounce, up 0.2 percent.
In emerging markets, stocks ( ) climbed 0.4 percent to a three-week high, supported by the weaker dollar. UBS analysts declared ""buying time"" for emerging stocks, upgrading Mexico, Poland and Colombia, while downgrading Brazil.

By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a three-week high on Thursday as investors raised their bets that the European Central Bank will next week signal a winding down of its vast bond-buying program by the end of this year.
The central bank's chief economist Peter Praet, a close ally of President Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday that the ECB would debate at its policy meeting next week whether to end bond purchases later this year.
Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's central bank, said expectations the ECB would taper its bond-buying program by the end of this year were plausible while his Dutch counterpart, Klaas Knot, said there was no reason to continue a quantitative easing program.
The comments drove the euro to $1.1838 ( ), up half a percent on the day and its highest since May 17.
Some analysts have taken the comments to suggest a decision is coming at the June 14 meeting but others saw it as the starting gun in a debate that will likely culminate in a decision in July.
Petr Krpata, currencies strategist at ING, said the most ""realistically bullish"" case was for the ECB to signal a one quarter extension of the bond-buying to end-December.
""If they say only one more quarter, that's the biggest upside potential for the euro,"" he said, adding that he was less bullish and expected the ECB to make the unwinding more open-ended and conditional on economic news.
He said the euro's strength was limited given concerns about a trade war that could hit big euro zone exporters, and the possibility of a more hawkish Federal Reserve when it meets next week and is expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year.
Many market players were surprised by the flurry of ECB comments as they had thought uncertainty caused by a political crisis in Italy would stay policymakers' hands.
Euro zone inflation will also need to stay close to the ECB's target for several months before policy is tightened, analysts said.
""Our economists remain highly sceptical about the development of (core) inflation in the euro zone,"" Commerzbank (DE: ) analysts wrote, describing some ""normalization fantasies"" as ""too high-flying"".
LIRA JUMPS
In emerging markets, the Turkish lira was the big mover of the day.
The lira surged more than three percent to below 4.47 lira against the dollar after the central bank hiked the benchmark interest rate by 125 basis points, more than expected.
The ( ) slipped 0.4 percent to its weakest since May 17, helping currencies including sterling claw back some of their recent losses.
Despite the improving mood among investors on Thursday many remain cautious, especially ahead of a summit this weekend of the Group of Seven leaders when President Donald Trump looks set to clash with his counterparts over trade.
After a six-week long rapid rally the dollar has failed to break above key levels against some of its rivals, raising concerns the greenback's weakness may have more room to run.
Against the yen , for example, it has failed to break above a 200 day moving average, potentially opening the door for more losses before a key G7 meeting this weekend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro rose to a nearly two-week high against the dollar on Wednesday after officials said the European Central Bank could wind down its stimulus program by the end of the year, as inflation has risen to its target.
Europe's common currency was on track to post its largest weekly gain versus the dollar since mid-February.
Having revived growth with an unprecedented 2.55 trillion euro ($2.99 trillion) bond purchase program, the ECB has been debating whether to end the purchases this year as the threat of deflation has passed and the bloc is on its best growth run in a decade.
Many traders expected the central bank to remain cautious at its June 14 policy meeting, given the uncertainty caused by a political crisis in Italy.
But ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday the central bank would next week debate whether to unwind bond purchases gradually.
Germany's central bank head said market expectations for an end to bond-buying this year were plausible.
""The notion that the ECB could end stimulus sooner rather than later is a boon for the euro as it suggests an earlier arrival of an eventual rate hike from rock-bottom levels,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
Praet's comments pushed the euro to $1.1796 ( ), the highest since May 22, and it also hit a more-than-one-week high of 1.1640 francs versus the safe-haven Swiss franc ( ).
""A breach of the $1.18 barrier will attract more euro bulls,"" said Viash Sreemuntoo, corporate trader at XE.
As well as boosting the euro, analysts said the comments would introduce heightened volatility in the options markets over the ECB meeting.
""Markets have already factored in a U.S. rate hike; that means the ECB is the most likely trigger for heightened volatility and I'm expecting to see that as we head into the meeting,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank (DE: ).
The euro's rise put pressure on the ( ), which measures the greenback versus a basket of six major currencies. The index fell 0.4 percent to 93.518.
The ECB comments followed a speech by Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose promise of radical change had a mixed impact on the euro.
""The Italians have a government and it is doing what it said it would do,"" said John Taylor, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.
""In itself that should be normal, but in this case it is shocking to the idea of Europe as it has be constructed by Brussels, the German government, and the ECB/Bundesbank,"" he added."

LONDON (Reuters) - Hawkish comments by the European Central Bank pushed borrowing costs across the euro zone higher on Wednesday, with the impact felt deepest in Italy where markets continue to reel from the prospect of big spending policies from a new government.
ECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday the central bank was increasingly confident that inflation is rising back to its target and will next week debate whether to gradually unwind bond purchases.
Expectations that the ECB will wind down its bond-buying programme by year-end are plausible, the head of Germany's central bank added.
The remarks, which come just a week ahead of a closely-watched ECB meeting, caught markets off guard. The recent turmoil in Italy had led some investors to bet the ECB would adopt a somewhat more cautious tone.
""The market is very sensitive to changes in the central bank outlook and with a change in the ECB's stance looming, the sensitivity is increasing,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea.
Ten-year German bond yields ( ) rose 5 basis points to 0.42 percent, its biggest daily rise in a week. With the exception of Italy, euro zone bond yields were 5-9 bps higher on the day across the bloc.
The euro also rose after Praet's comments, hitting a 10-day high against the dollar ( ).

Italian bonds once again stood out as the underperformer as the new government shows no desire to tone down its big-spending plans for the euro zone's third-biggest economy.
Ten-year bond yields jumped 20 basis points to 2.96 percent ( ), while short-dated bond yields were up 33 bps at 1.32 percent ( ).
The average daily change in basis points over the last 7 sessions for 2-year Italian bonds has been 65 bps, according to Deutsche Bank (DE: ).
Though Italian bond yields remained well below their peak last week, analysts said a combination of a hawkish ECB and a likely fiscally profligate Italian government would keep upward pressure alive on peripheral debt.
""It is a signal that if we get tighter policy it is these countries that will suffer more than Germany,"" Nordea's Gerich said.
UBS analysts estimate the ambitious fiscal spending plans of Italy's new government would blow out its fiscal deficit to 4.4 of GDP and push its primary surplus from 1.9 percent of GDP to well into negative territory at minus 3.9 percent by 2020.
""There has been a bit of reaction to Praet. But at the moment it's difficult to disentangle market response to what's going on in the BTP market,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
As bond markets sold off after the ECB comments, money market pricing suggested investors were ratchet up their rate-hike bets once more.
Money markets now price roughly a 90 percent chance that the ECB will hike rates by July next year . Last week, amid the Italy turmoil, a hike was not fully priced in until October 2019.
Elsewhere, U.S. ten-year Treasury yields ( ) edged 2 basis points higher at 2.94 percent, not far away from the psychologically significant 3 percent levels where it traded recently as markets geared up for a rate hike next week."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan rose to a more than one-week high against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday helped by firmer central bank guidance, but gains were capped by rising corporate demand for the greenback.
Prior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 6.4040 per dollar, 117 pips firmer than the previous fix and in line with a softer dollar.
The spot market opened at 6.4036 per dollar and climbed to 6.3910 at one point, the strongest since May 28.
As of midday, the spot yuan was changing hands at 6.3951, 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.14 percent stronger than the midpoint.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies due to a firmer euro ( ) and concerns that the United States could pull out of a trade pact with Canada and Mexico. [FRX/]
Traders said the 6.4 per dollar was a psychologically important level for investors, with rising corporate demand for the greenback emerging after the yuan strengthened past the threshold.
""The yuan didn't change its direction to a strengthening path as (many corporate clients) were scooping up cheaper dollars in morning trade,"" a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai said.
The trader expected the yuan could face some downward pressure in the near term as June marks a traditional peak for dollar demand.
Some market participants said the yuan could also face volatility from the outcome of the European Central Bank's policy meeting on June 14, which could put pressure on emerging markets if the ECB states when its stimulative policy will end.
Separately, the PBOC lent 463 billion yuan ($72.40 billion) to financial institutions on Wednesday via its 1-year medium-term lending facility (MLF), with interest rates unchanged.
Analysts believe the central bank may be adjusting the way it conducts its various liquidity operations as financing conditions change, with Wednesday's move possibly pushing back the timing of another expected cut in banks' reserve requirement ratios.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar gained against the yen on Monday after the release of an upbeat U.S. jobs report, although uncertainty over potential political risks kept the currency's near-term outlook murky.
The dollar added 0.15 percent to 109.660 yen following a rise of 0.6 percent on Friday.
Closely watched data out on Friday showed U.S. jobs growth gathering pace and wages rising in May, making a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in June a near certainty and increasing expectations of a fourth hike this year.
The robust U.S. jobs report helped offset factors that had weighed on the dollar earlier last week, such as a flare up in trade tensions between the United States and its allies.
""The jobs report was strong but other recent U.S. data also point to strong fundamentals, helping the dollar recover losses suffered from risk aversion. Uncertainty over the U.S.-North Korea summit next week is still likely to cap the dollar's upside,"" said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays (LON: ) in Tokyo.
The greenback dipped against a basket of six major currencies, weighed by the euro's bounce against the greenback. The slipping 0.15 percent to 94.029 ( ) after gaining about 0.2 percent on Friday.
The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1685 ( ), recovering the bulk of Friday's losses.
The prospect of a snap election in Italy shook investor risk sentiment at the start of last week as some feared the vote could be a referendum on the country's euro membership.
But the euro has drifted up since as markets gained some composure after anti-establishment parties reached a deal to resurrect their proposed coalition government, averting potentially destabilizing elections.
""While worries over Italy may have subsided somewhat, the bottom line is that the U.S. economy is doing better than its European peers, and this will continue to weigh on the euro,"" Kadota at Barclays said.
The single currency remained in sight of a 10-month low of $1.1510 set earlier last week when concerns over Italian politics peaked in the global markets.
""Focus will likely shift back from Italy to European Central Bank policy,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
""The prospect of the ECB immediately following the Fed in normalizing monetary policy has waned. The euro will be sensitive to any comments by ECB officials which suggest the central bank is less enthusiastic about normalizing policy.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro consolidated gains on Friday and is set to break a six-week losing streak following a drop in Italian bond yields after a revived coalition deal between Italy's two anti-establishment parties reduced concerns of immediate elections.
The single currency plunged earlier this week and Italian bond yields soared, with 2-year bond yields posting their biggest one-day jump in 26 years on Tuesday on fears that fresh elections in the euro zone's third biggest economy could strengthen the hand of anti-establishment parties.
But the past two days have seen some stability with the euro recouping its losses thanks in part to renewed efforts to form a government and avoid new elections, ending three months of political turmoil.
Analysts were also getting more cautious of the dollar's recent move higher -- the greenback hit a 6-1/2 month high against a basket of its rivals earlier this week -- on trade war fears and rising concerns the U.S. economic momentum may soften.
""At these levels, I think the dollar is nearly priced to perfection and we think the euro should see a rebound from later this year,"" said Paul Baird, head of fixed income at Newton Asset Management, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon which manages $49.8 billion in assets globally.
On Friday, the euro ( ) was flat at $1.1691 against the dollar. On a weekly basis, it is set to eke out a small 0.3 percent gain, snapping six consecutive weeks of losses.
The dollar edged higher at 94.02 after posting its biggest monthly rise since November 2016 in May against a basket of rivals ( ). It headed back towards a 6-1/2 month high of 95.03 hit earlier this week.
Risk appetite was on the back foot after the Donald Trump administration slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Mexico and Canada, raising risks of a full blown trade war.
Canada and Mexico retaliated against the United State's decision while the European Union had its own reprisals ready to go..
The Canadian dollar stood at C$1.2936 to the U.S. dollar , after falling 0.65 percent the previous day.
The Mexican peso hit a 15-month low of 20.050 to the dollar on Thursday and last stood at 19.85 per dollar.
A heavy slate of data on Friday is also expected to keep investors on the sidelines. The US jobs report for May is expected to show almost 190,000 jobs added, keeping the Fed on track to raise rates later this month. Flash PMIs in euro zone, United States and Britain are also due."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Wednesday from 10-month lows after reports that Italy's biggest party would make a renewed attempt to form a coalition government and end months of political turmoil.
An attempt by two anti-establishment parties to form a new government in Italy collapsed at the weekend, raising the prospect of an early election. Markets feared that election would become a de facto referendum on Italy's use of the euro.
A source close to 5-Star, the single largest party in the new parliament, said the party would try again to form a coalition with the right-wing League. Without a deal, sources said President Sergio Mattarella could dissolve parliament in the coming days and send Italians back to the polls as early as July 29.
The euro rallied and Italian government bond yields ( ) settled below multi-year highs after Tuesday's market slide.
A smooth auction of Italian government debt also helped soothe market jitters.
The single currency, which plunged to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday, rose as much as 0.7 percent to $1.1624 ( ) on Wednesday. It remains down 4 percent this month against the dollar.
Analysts said the euro was still at risk of falling.
""The risk to the euro is predominantly political in the near term ... We are confident that the euro is capped,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ). The bank doubts the euro can rise much above $1.15 or $1.16 until the Italian crisis is resolved, he said.
After major moves on Tuesday, foreign exchange markets traded on a quieter note.
The euro had dropped 1 percent against the safe-haven Swiss franc on Tuesday in its biggest daily fall since September, but it recovered 0.6 percent to 1.1508 francs ( ).
Against the yen, the euro rose to 126.285 yen ( ) after hitting an 11-month low of 124.62 yen overnight, down from about 131 yen last week.
The Swedish crown , a big loser in recent weeks, recovered against the dollar after Tuesday's drop. It also gained against the euro ( ).
The , measured against a basket of currencies, slipped 0.4 percent to 94.442 ( ) and below Tuesday's 6 1/2- month high. The dollar remained steady against the yen .
Signs of a possible escalation in trade frictions between the United States and China continued to worry investors, after the White House said that it could still impose tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China .
U.S. bond yields have fallen over the past couple of days, undermining the dollar's yield attraction and a key reason for the currency's rally.
That, however, is not stopping analysts from predicting more dollar strength.
Rabobank analysts said that while the pace of the drop in the euro/dollar had outpaced their expectations, they had cut their 12-month euro/dollar forecast to $1.12 from $1.15.
""With market attention firmly back on political risk ... the outlook for the euro has clearly soured. Added to this is our existing arguments regarding the more constructive outlook for the U.S. dollar,"" the analysts said."

Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, listens during a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2018. Powell said the central bank can continue gradually raising interest rates as the outlook for growth remains strong, and the recent bout of financial volatility shouldn\\'t weigh on the U.S. economy.
(Bloomberg) -- For investors surveying the global market map, it helps to get back to basics -- and there are few more fundamental principles than this: When the world’s central bank makes borrowing more expensive, bad stuff is likely to happen.
The Federal Reserve may not be raising at a lightning pace by historic standards, but it is shifting from a period of unprecedented easing. The result is a form of tightening “we do not fully understand,” according to Deutsche Bank.
Cue the bank’s advice to dust off that copy of Financial Markets 101.
“We should not overcomplicate the macro picture,” Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s New York-based macro strategist, wrote in a note this week. “Fed tightening can be likened to the monetary authorities shaking a tree with some overripe fruit. It is usually not totally obvious what will fall out, but that there is ‘fall out’ should be no surprise.”
To illustrate his point, Ruskin highlighted key periods of rate hikes over the past five decades and the corresponding consequences. The causes and effects could no doubt be debated all day, but his underlying point is timely -- cracks have been appearing across a swathe of global assets in the past two weeks.
While nothing seems to have fallen from the tree as yet, the list of potential “overripe fruit” is growing. The has plumbed the lowest level in six months, peripheral European debt has tumbled, Treasury volatility has jumped.
And then there’s the asset class Ruskin chose to highlight in his note: emerging markets. Developing-nation currencies, for example, are the most volatile relative to G-7 peers in more than two years as the dollar rebounds.
“At the moment there are a host of idiosyncratic stories in EM that look to belargely tangential victims,” said Ruskin. “Where the U.S. rate cycle is relevant is that the past extreme external policy accommodation can no longer mask domestic issues including valuation extremes like compressed credit spreads.”
Put more simply: The Fed is shaking the tree.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) said on Thursday that any systemic spillovers from Italian political risks into peripheral Europe could push the euro down against the dollar by ""around five big figures.""
The prospect of a coalition government between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League, bent on big spending plans that would put Italy on a collision course with the European Union, have rattled markets in the past week.
""Should this become a more systemic event...we estimate that could fall by around 5 big figures,"" the U.S. bank said in a note published on Thursday.
However, it said as long as Italian risk remains confined to the country, the euro is unlikely to suffer from any additional political risks.
Goldman said the current level of Italian bond yields trades close to two standard deviations above its fair value with a political premium of around 40-50 basis points.
It said it does not see Italy bond-yield spreads widening to levels that would create systemic ripple effects across euro zone and that fair value for the Italy/German 10-year bond yield spread is around 120 basis points. That spread was 186 bps on Thursday."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is a long-term and responsible investor in the euro ( ) and hopes the currency will be strong and steady, in spite of the occasional sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday.
The euro is set to slump for a sixth consecutive week against the dollar - the longest weekly losing streak since January 2015 - hobbled by worries over an economic slowdown in the currency bloc.
The euro has also been hit by concerns that an incoming coalition Italian government will implement big-spending policies, adding to the country's large debt.
""The euro is an important choice in our foreign currency reserves, and so we are continuing to buy European debt,"" Li said.
""Even when certain European countries had sovereign debt crises, China kept the broader picture in mind.""
The premier said a strong euro benefits the currency.
""We hope the euro can be strong and steady. We have a large amount of foreign reserves. We believe that foreign exchange reserves can't just be put in one basket,"" he said.
Li's show of confidence in the euro came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited China.
In a joint media appearance with Merkel at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Li said China and Germany both upheld global free trade, and stressed the huge potential for cooperation between them.
The euro traded slightly higher at around $1.1700 on Thursday after hitting a six-month low of $1.1676 on Wednesday on a rash of poorer-than-expected economic data out of Germany, France and the broader euro zone."

By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar lost momentum on Thursday after the double-whammy of dovish-looking minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting and the threat by U.S. President Donald Trump of imposing new tariffs on imported cars.
The euro was hampered by concerns over an economic slowdown in the currency bloc and political risks in Italy, staying near a six-month low against the dollar and a nine-month nadir versus the yen.
Measured against a basket of six major currencies ( ) ( ), the dollar stepped back to 98.865 from its five-month high of 94.195 hit just before the release of the Fed's minutes.
While most policymakers thought it likely another interest rate increase would be warranted - in line with market expectations - the minutes showed the Fed would tolerate inflation rising above its goal for a time.
""The minutes suggested the Fed is not in a hurry to raise interest rates. The U.S. stock markets seem to like that they were not too hawkish,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust bank.
Moreover, the minutes also showed the board members generally agreed to make a small adjustment in its policy implementation by raising the interest rates on its excess reserves by 20 basis points, rather than by a widely anticipated 25 basis points.
Their discussion, while highly technical, came as a surprise to market players and helped bring down short-term U.S. interest rates and bond yields.
""This means the effective interest rates in the future have shifted five basis points lower over a long period of time. In other words, we could even say the Fed today cut rates by five basis points,"" said Toru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities.
The dollar's fall accelerated as Trump appeared to have opened a new front in the trade war by considering new tariffs, this time on cars, just days after Washington agreed with China to put ""on hold"" its plan to impose tariffs on $150 billion worth Chinese goods.
Against the yen, the dollar shed as much as 0.6 percent to 109.45 yen , a day after it had fallen 0.73 percent, its biggest fall in nearly three months. It last stood at 109.61 yen, down 0.4 percent on the day.
The safe-haven Swiss franc also ticked up 0.2 percent to 0.9943 franc to the dollar , helped by investors' cautious mood. It hit a three-week high of 0.9894 per dollar on Wednesday.
The euro bounced back slightly to $1.1705 ( ) after hitting a six-month low of $1.1676 on Wednesday but the common currency was held back by economic and political worries in Europe.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good guide to the euro zone's economic health, sank in May to an 18-month low, suggesting the continent's strong growth last year has lost steam.
Investors were unnerved by political developments in Italy, where the coalition government proposed by the anti-establishment 5-Star and far-right League could tap eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as economy minister.
The Italian debt yields have jumped in the past couple of weeks, with the 10-year government bond yield ( ) rising more than 50 basis points.
The common currency was soft against the yen, hitting a nine-month low of 128.24 yen ( ) on Wednesday.
""I think there is risk of further downward revision in the European economic outlook. Earlier this year, people thought the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve will all raise interest rates. But now the ECB has clearly dropped out,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of forex at State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo."

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a five-month peak on Monday as news of a truce between the United States and China on trade tariffs prompted investors to pare back their short positions on the greenback.
Investors have been short the dollar since July last year, but since mid-February, the has rallied nearly 7 percent. The dollar has been mainly bolstered by generally solid U.S. economic data that has backed the Federal Reserve's tightening stance this year.
The prospect of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade tension has further added to the dollar's shine.
The two world's largest economies have agreed to drop their tariff threats for now. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Sunday the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.
""While there have seemingly been few signs of concrete progress in those negotiations, the more constructive tone from the two sides appears to be lending some support to the risk environment,"" said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Securities in New York.
That news also boosted U.S. equities and Treasury yields, underpinning the dollar as a result.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index ( ) rose 0.1 percent to 93.748 after earlier hitting a five-month high above 94.
This week, the dollar's fate rests on the Federal Reserve, with several Fed officials speaking this week and the minutes of the U.S. central bank's last monetary policy meeting due out on Wednesday.
""If the minutes take note of inflation creeping higher, it could open the door to faster rate hikes and a stronger dollar,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
In other currency pairs, the dollar rose to a four-month high against the yen at 111.39 and was last at 111.13, up 0.4 percent. The yen has been pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, a U.S.-China trade war truce and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said.
The euro, meanwhile, was flat against the dollar at $1.1770 , after earlier falling to its lowest since around mid-November. Europe's single currency has been affected by concerns about political uncertainty in Italy.
This week will bring about a further test for stubborn euro bulls with the release of May flash PMI data on Wednesday where markets will be waiting to see whether the first quarter slowdown in Europe has spilled over to the subsequent months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks and the dollar rose but gave up some gains on Monday after the U.S.-China trade war was declared ""on hold"", while in Europe Italy's borrowing costs climbed and the Milan bourse retreated as two anti-establishment parties got closer to power.
Wall Street was set to open higher, with U.S. S&P mini futures ( ) up 0.6 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 ( ) was up 0.3 percent, hovering near 3-month highs and London's FTSE 100 ( ) hit a new record, up 0.5 percent following a positive session in Asia.
""There's certainly a 'feel-good' sentiment on risky assets"" due to the U.S. trade announcement, said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared the U.S. trade war with China ""on hold"" following an agreement to drop their tariff threats that have roiled global markets this year.
Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and U.S. negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future.
Barbier de la Serre cautioned, however, that given the lack of details available about the agreement between Washington and Beijing, it was too early to call it a definitive turning point.
He added that a number of question marks, such as on the prospects for world growth, inflation and rising rates, should also keep investors on their toes.
As safe-haven demand for debt fell, U.S. bond prices were under pressure, keeping their yields not far from last week's peaks with the 10-year Treasuries yield at 3.072 percent, ( ) near a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit on Friday.
In the currency market, higher U.S. yields helped to strengthen the dollar about 0.15 percent against a basket of currencies while the euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1762 ( ).
Italian politics contributed to the pressure on the euro as the far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of Italy's debt pile. http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh
""It is something that creates a lot of nervousness, but of course on the other hand one has to wait"", ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday morning.
The Milan bourse started the day sharply lower but progressively clawed back losses and limited its fall to 0.8 percent.
Italy's 10-year bond yield rose to nearly three percent in early morning trade, its highest level since July 2017 but also eased back to about 2.28 percent.
Oil prices, which had initially held firm near 3-1/2-year highs on the easing trade tensions, edged down.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro was headed on Friday for its fifth successive weekly decline versus the dollar, in what would be a first for the currency since 2015, as political uncertainty in Italy continued to worry investors.
The euro has slumped six cents from more than $1.24 in the space of three weeks after a huge dollar rally and amid concerns about the demands of populist parties likely to form Italy's next government.
On Thursday, the far-right League and 5-Star Movement agreed the basis for a governing accord that would slash taxes and ramp up welfare spending.
Ratings agency DBRS warned that the economic proposals of the anti-establishment parties could threaten Italy's sovereign credit rating.
The euro on Friday inched up 0.2 percent to $1.1814 ( ). But the currency has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week and on Wednesday dropped to a five-month low of $1.1763.
""The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence... at this point a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance [in Italy] does seem likely,"" said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.
A founding member of the EU and the euro, Italy accounts for 15.4 percent of Eurozone GDP and the parties' hostility toward the European Union stance is the biggest challenge to the bloc since Britain voted to leave two years ago.
Still, some investors have played down the broader impact on the euro and questioned whether the Italian parties will really follow through on such plans.
A powerful rally by the dollar is also hurting the euro.
On Friday the greenback edged higher against the yen and set a fresh four-month high, buoyed by a further rise in U.S. Treasury yields ( ) that suggests a an upbeat outlook for the world's largest economy.
The dollar, which has risen 5 percent since mid-February, touched a high of 111.005 yen on Friday, its strongest level since Jan. 23.
""Moves in U.S. yields remain the focus. If they rise further the dollar could strengthen on the back of that and pull the dollar higher against the yen,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays (LON: ) in Tokyo
Investors are betting that U.S. interest rates will need to rise further to curb inflation.
That has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating it would fall in 2018 to rush to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.
In a note to clients, strategists at Citibank said the current rally in the dollar would not last long.
The U.S. budget deficit, which is projected to balloon to more than $1 trillion in 2019, they said, would contribute to a drop of 5 percent in the over the next 12 months.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro fell towards a five-month low on Thursday as investors fretted about the demands of populist parties likely to form Italy's next government and as a fresh rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields underpinned demand for the dollar.
The euro has slumped six cents from more than $1.24 in the space of three weeks after a huge dollar rally. Investors are betting that U.S. interest rates will need to rise further to curb inflation while other central banks are postponing monetary tightening.
That has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating it would fall in 2018 to rush to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.
Some analysts say the market remains complacent about the possibility of a rising dollar, which also notched up a four-month high against the Japanese yen on Thursday as 10-year Treasury yields ( ) approached their highest since 2011.
The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.1787 ( ), slightly above the $1.1763 2018 low it hit on Wednesday.
""This sense of a market that is not particularly well prepared for a euro decline is supported by the benign valuations still evident in the pricing of six-month and 12-month implied volatility,"" BNY Mellon analysts said in a note, referring to prices of a measure of expected swings in the value of the euro.
The rose 0.1 percent to 93.502 ( ), below its 2018 high of 93.632.
The euro is also suffering from reports Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League, which are working to draft a coalition program, may ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros of debt.
But broader Italian markets held up better on Thursday as investors played down the broader impact on euro zone political stability and questioned whether the Italian parties would really follow through on such plans.
""The sheer outlandishness of some leaked plans helped ease investor concerns a bit. The would-be coalition's denials that leaked draft policies were ever concrete plans also helped smooth markets,"" said Ken Odeluga, an analyst at City Index.
Sterling gave up earlier gains after the UK government dismissed a media report that Britain wanted to stay in the European Union's customs union after Brexit.

Volatile emerging market currencies, the biggest losers from the dollar's recovery, took another beating.
Rising Treasury yields have enhanced the dollar's appeal and raised global borrowing costs. For emerging markets with current account deficits that means higher costs and the risk of fund outflows and their currencies declining further, analysts say.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a five-month low on Wednesday after reports that a possible future Italian government would seek debt forgiveness from European creditors and as the dollar resumed its month-long and powerful rally.
The euro fell as much as half a percent to $1.1783 ( ), its lowest since late December, after reports surfaced that Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League plan to ask the ECB to forgive 250 billion euros of debt.
The single currency had initially shrugged off the news from Italy but with the dollar restarting its rally, the euro succumbed to selling pressures.
""This news from Italy has contributed to the weakening of the euro against the dollar,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ).
""Once an Italian government is formed the market will be keen to know the details of the fiscal policy. Are they really going to push for this write-off from the ECB? That's the one big question mark,"" he said.
The euro also fell sharply against the safe-haven Swiss franc, to a five-week low of 1.1799 francs. ( )
The euro had been a top performer in 2018, with traders betting on prolonged dollar weakness because of the United States' trade and budget deficits and investors expecting to allocate more money to the euro zone as its economy strengthens.
Bets that the Federal Reserve will in fact be an outlier in tightening monetary policy among major central banks and signs the euro zone's economy recovery has peaked has unwound that entire euro strength and the currency is now down 1.8 percent in 2018.
The single currency's decline on Wednesday was helped by a resurgent dollar, which hit a five-month high underpinned by gains in long-term U.S. Treasury yields.
The versus a basket of six major peers rose 0.3 percent to 93.517 ( ) after rallying to 93.457 overnight, its highest since Dec. 22.
The U.S. currency has gained since mid-April and clawed back its 2018 losses after a reassessment of the path of U.S. monetary policy versus other countries.
Moves by China and the United States to avoid a full-blown trade war have allowed investors to focus on the yield advantage the United States enjoys over other countries.
The dollar rally stalled last week after weaker-than-expected April U.S. inflation data but was lifted on Tuesday when strong U.S. consumer spending numbers sent 10-year Treasury yields ( ) surging to a seven-year peak of 3.095 percent.
""Today could see a repeat of yesterday. Momentum would certainly seem to back a further dollar advance with little to stop U.S. 10-year Treasury yields pushing to 3.20 percent,"" said ING FX strategist Viraj Patel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Italian stocks slid on Wednesday after reports that the two parties seeking to form Italy's next government might seek debt forgiveness, while the dollar ignored a pull-back in U.S. bond yields and rallied to a new 2018 high.
Asian markets had earlier dipped after Pyongyang abruptly called off talks with Seoul, throwing a U.S.-North Korean summit into doubt, but that failed to rattle European stocks.
Markets were also unfazed by Italian politics and the bigger focus was a rocketing dollar and rising U.S. borrowing costs, which have spooked investors in recent weeks and intensified concern about damage to global demand, squeezing emerging markets.
The dollar resumed its rally in European trading and reached a high for the year ( ). That gain left the euro below $1.18 ( ), its lowest since Dec. 19.
However, with 10-year Treasury yields slipping back below 7-year highs reached earlier this week, most European stock markets traded close to flat.
The exception was Italy. Reports suggested the 5-Star and League parties, trying to form a government after inconclusive March 4 elections, had written a draft coalition deal asking for debt forgiveness from the European Central Bank (ECB), frightening investors in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
""The proposal is surreal. Pretending the unilateral cancellation of 250 billion euros of debt bought by the ECB as part of the QE program... would be absurd,"" Anthilia Capital Partners fund manager Giuseppe Sersale said.
""Even if unfeasible, the tone of the debate bolsters expectations there will be a stormy relationship with Europe and a further relaxation of financial discipline,"" he said.
Italian stocks fell more than 1.5 percent ( ) while the pan-European STOXX 600 ( ) slipped 0.12 percent.
Euro zone banks slid an even bigger 1.71 percent ( ), extending losses despite a League spokesman saying the request for cancellation of the debt was not in the official draft of the government program.
The difference in Italian 10-year government borrowing costs ( ) over German ( ) rose sharply to the highest since late March.
The MSCI world equity index ( ), which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped into negative territory.
U.S. stock futures traded down 1.25 percent ( ).
TREASURY YIELDS PAUSE
North Korea's cancellation of a June 12 summit in Singapore added to geopolitical worries for financial markets, given it could see tensions on the Korean peninsula flare again and damage U.S.-China efforts to resolve an ongoing trade dispute.
""This will weigh on the Korean reconstruction beneficiaries that have had a strong run on peace and even reunification hopes recently,"" JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts wrote in a note.
""The broader risk for the region if talks do break down is that Trump no longer feels the need to keep China on side and could escalate trade tensions again.""
Elsewhere, the 10-year yield ( ) slipped to 3.057 percent.
Strong U.S. retail sales and factory data on Tuesday pushed the U.S. 10-year yield as high as 3.095 percent, its highest since July 2011, raising worries about higher borrowing costs for companies worldwide.
The U.S. currency has enjoyed a blistering rally in recent weeks as investors focus on the Federal Reserve raising interest rates while central banks elsewhere push back policy tightening.
Rising U.S. borrowing costs and a stronger dollar hit hardest in emerging markets, where investors are withdrawing money - particularly from countries with large deficits and big dollar funding needs.
Argentina and Turkey have been at the center of the sell-off, their weakness compounded by political frictions.
The Turkish lira had been testing record lows against both the dollar and the euro but clawed higher after officials from the central bank said they would be prepared to act to halt the rout.
President Tayyip Erdogan's comments that he plans to take greater control of the economy have hammered the lira this week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar inched up against a basket of currencies on Tuesday from its lowest level in more than a week as hopes for an easing of global trade tensions pushed U.S. bond yields higher.
The dollar's index versus a basket of six major peers rose about 0.1 percent to 92.647 ( ), pulling up from 92.243 on Monday, which was its lowest level since May 2.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up about 1 basis point in Asian trading to 3.001 percent ( ), after rising 2 basis points on Monday.
The benchmark yield was supported by signs of an easing in trade tensions between the United States and China after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp (HK: ), which has been penalized for violating U.S. sanctions with Iran.
The dollar, which hit a four-month index high of 93.416 last week, has lost steam after soft April U.S. consumer price data raised doubts as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates as many as four times in 2018.
But some traders remain upbeat about its near-term outlook.
Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore, said he is comfortable remaining long U.S. dollar, with interest rate differentials still likely to work in its favor.
Innes said he would probably remain dollar positive until there is a wave of positive economic data from countries other than the United States, or until the European Central Bank starts to sound ""overtly hawkish instead of just tentatively"".
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1932 ( ), but remained below Monday's high of $1.1996, which was the common currency's highest level since May 3.
The euro had briefly strengthened on Monday after European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that the ECB could give fresh guidance on the timing of its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches.
Still, some analysts are skeptical of the dollar's upside potential.
""Higher energy and commodity prices globally as well as tightness in labor markets should feed through to inflation and bring back the case of monetary stimulus removal for other majors at some stage,"" the Maybank analysts wrote in a research note.
""We still look for U.S. dollar gains since mid-April to reverse further,"" they said.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 109.72 .
Major currencies showed limited reaction to the latest batch of Chinese economic data, which overall showed signs of a further slowing in economic momentum.

Selling pressure in the dollar continued, however, as some strategists claimed that the greenback, which hit a high of 93.26 last week, was nearing its peak.
ING said last week it remained convinced that by the end of the year - and into 2019 – “structural forces” would drive the dollar to weaker levels.
The divergence between US growth and interest rates compared to the rest of the world – one of the reasons for the recent dollar rally – was nearing its peak, the bank warned. The dollar rose to year-to-date high of 93.26 on Wednesday.

Trump's comments on Sunday came ahead of a second round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this week to resolve an escalating trade dispute. China had said last week its stance in the negotiations would not change.

Veteran Mahathir Mohamad, 92, came out of political retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory, defeating prime minister Najib Razak, a former protege whom he had accused of corruption.

But some analysts believe Mahathir's proposals could be positive for the economy.
""The repeal of GST, while only marginally negative for the fiscal deficit, will be a boon for consumers, who have been upset that they bear the burden of poor fiscal management and came out to vote against the establishment,"" said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis.
OIL AND IRAN
While tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East.
Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world's oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices to near multi-year highs.
Citi analyst Mark Schofield said rising oil prices risk causing 'stagflation', which could create a particularly ""hostile environment"" for risk assets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Thursday after the 10-year U.S. bond yield popped above the psychologically important 3 percent mark and investors looked to U.S. consumer price data later in the day that could show an acceleration in inflation.
The stood little changed against a basket of six major currencies ( ) ( ) at 93.02 after hitting a 4-1/2-month high of 93.42, extending its gains from its April low to 4.7 percent.
""Rises in U.S. interest rates are pushing the dollar higher,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, noting that investor sentiment is stronger now than in February when worries about higher rates hit stock prices.
""At the moment, inflation is higher and there's no major risk-off factors, with even the U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal having a minor impact. In that kind of environment, interest rate differentials will end up being the main driver for the dollar,"" she said.
U.S. consumer price data due at 1230 GMT is expected to show that annual core CPI inflation [USCPFY=ECI] rose to 2.2 percent in April, which would be the highest in more than a year, from 2.1 percent in March.
U.S. producer price inflation on Wednesday was slightly weaker than expected, however, this had little impact on market sentiment.
The 10-year U.S. bond yield rose above 3 percent ( ) on Wednesday, edging near its 2014 peak of 3.041 percent. It last stood at 2.988 percent.
The dollar stood little changed at 109.73 yen , but remained close to its three-month high of 110.05 yen touched on May 2.
The euro hit a 4-1/2-month low of $1.1823 on Wednesday, having fallen in six of the last seven sessions. It last traded at $1.1863 ( ).
The British pound hovered above Monday's four-month low as traders expect the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at its meeting later in the day.
A recent run of weak UK economic data and renewed worries about Brexit have led markets to price out the possibility of a rate hike this month.
The pound last stood flat at $1.3561 , not far from $1.3485 touched on Monday.
The New Zealand dollar shed as much as 1.1 percent to a five-month low of $0.6916 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held interest rates steady and said the next move in rates could just as easily be a cut as a hike.
""The RBNZ surprised markets with a slight dovish shift. It kept the OCR (official cash rate) on hold, as was widely expected, but notably allowed for the OCR to move 'up or down', rather than simply on hold – a slightly dovish development in our view,"" said Imre Speizer, economist at Westpac in Auckland.
The Malaysian ringgit fell 2.4 percent in the non-deliverable forward market, its biggest daily fall in a year and a half, after Malaysia's ruling coalition that has dominated the country for six decades was unexpectedly voted out of power.

Financial markets have so far showed muted response to reports of skirmishes between Israel and Syria, though some market players said they warrant more caution.
Israel launched dozens of rockets into Syria early on Thursday, destroying a radar installation and hitting an ammunitions dump, Syrian state media reported while Israel's military said Iranian forces in Syria had shelled one of its outposts in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights.
That took place amid rising expectations of a regional flare-up after U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on Tuesday that Washington would pull out of a nuclear deal with Iran.

By Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The dollar's newfound shine will fade as the U.S. economy's strength and higher interest rates won't support the currency's resurgence for longer than another three months at most, a Reuters poll found.
After falling over 2 percent in the first quarter, in April the dollar made its biggest monthly gain since November 2016 by recouping those losses and is now up close to one percent for the year against a basket of currencies. (For a graphic on world FX rates in 2018 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh)
But medians in the latest poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken May 3-9 forecast the greenback to be weaker in a year, leaving the euro ( ) up about 7 percent from where it is now.
""Analyzing the three key drivers of this dollar move – and their temporary nature – means we do not see much further scope for dollar upside,"" noted Viraj Patel, foreign exchange strategist at ING.
""We modestly raise our USD forecasts for the summer, but remain convinced that by the end of the year – and into 2019 – structural forces will drive the dollar to levels weaker than where it currently trades today.""
Over two-thirds of the 66 respondents who answered a separate question said the recent dollar resurgence wouldn't last longer than three months, including 20 percent who expected it to end within a month.
Responses to another question showed over 60 percent of 55 strategists saying risks to their dollar forecasts were skewed more to the upside over the next three months.
However, in line with a weaker dollar view held in Reuters polls since almost the beginning of last year, strategists again forecast the greenback to fall over the coming year against most major currencies.
That suggests the latest dollar rally is partially driven by currency speculators unwinding bets against the greenback to the lowest in seven weeks, down sharply from a 6-1/2-year high net short position held last month.
""When dissecting the anatomy of this USD correction, we feel it exhibits all the hallmarks of a short squeeze. Positioning had clearly been stretched,"" Patel added.
Economic data out of the U.S. have largely been positive and reinforced the view for further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in June and repeat that move twice more in 2018. [ECILT/US]
At the same time, there are clear signs the euro zone and British economies are cooling.
The Bank of England will wait until August before raising interest rates, according to another Reuters poll in which nearly all economists pushed back previous expectations of a hike on Thursday. [BOE/INT]
Britain's pound fell to a fresh four-month low on Tuesday as the dollar extended its rally.
Still, sterling's recent slide was expected to be short-lived, with the currency forecast to bounce back over the coming year. [GBP/POLL]
The euro zone's economic growth momentum, already moderating partly from a stronger currency, slowed in the first quarter and inflation unexpectedly took a hit in April, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to end its over 2.5 trillion euro bond buying scheme later this year.
While the dollar did strengthen last month and may continue to in the near-term, the euro and other major currencies are expected to reverse losses and be up in a year.
The euro ( ) is forecast to trade higher at $1.27 in a year's time, up nearly 7 percent from around $1.19 on Wednesday.
""Long-term risks remain tilted to the downside for the greenback. The maturing U.S. cycle, the fiscal imbalances, the political context...in conjunction with the U.S. external policies risk triggering additional USD weakness in the long run,"" wrote Roberto Cobo Garcia, currency strategist at BBVA (MC: ).

LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, while the dollar touched a new high for the year and world stocks held steady.
Trump's move sparked fears of increased tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over global oil supplies. [O/R]
Demand for safe-haven assets remained muted as the immediate market impact was seen as specific to oil supply, but investors remained mindful of the knock-on effects on inflation.
Gold prices retreated and bond yields rose. The U.S. 10-year Treasury ( ) once again breached the psychologically significant 3-percent level and hit a two-week high of 3.0140 percent, supported by expectations of higher interest rates.
""In an environment where the Fed, particularly, is already at its inflation target and people are closely watching the pace of the monetary tightening, something like this which could possibly nudge inflation a little bit higher is going to be quite interesting for the market,"" UBS Wealth Management's UK chief investment office deputy head, Caroline Simmons, said.
""That's why you're seeing the yields go up a little bit on the bonds,"" she said.
The impact of Trump's decision was mostly limited to oil markets and energy-related stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ( ) hit their highest level since November 2014 at $71.17 per barrel, last up 2.7 percent.
Brent crude futures ( ) jumped as much as 2.8 percent to a 3-1/2-year high of $77.20.
""There is still an interim period before sanctions kick in. And other signatories and Iran want to keep the deal going so there is a period where things could be hammered out,"" ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder said.
""But I would have expected a bit of a safe-haven bid this morning,"" he noted, referring to bonds.
The MSCI world equity index ( ), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat and continued to trade in a narrow range. The pan-European STOXX 600 ( ) meanwhile rose 0.2 percent as oil majors gained and earnings from Siemens (DE: ) and Imperial Brands (L: ) dominated trading.
In the U.S., stocks futures pointed to a positive start for Wall Street, with E-Mini futures for the ( ) up 0.5 percent.
""In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,"" Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Securities senior investment strategist Norihiro Fujito said.
""U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,"" he said.
The reaction in Asian markets was more pronounced as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have dealings with Iran. Trump's move is also seen as likely to worsen already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) was up 0.1 percent, while Japan's Nikkei ( ) fell 0.4 percent.
Iran, the third-biggest OPEC producer, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4 percent of the world's oil supplies.
The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran's oil sector and transactions with its central bank.
DOLLAR STEPS BACK FROM HIGH
The rise in Treasury yields helped fuel the dollar's rally, with the greenback hitting a new 2018 high before giving up gains.
The against a basket of major currencies ( ) was at 93.026. It has risen about 1 percent this year.
Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been depressed in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets.
Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit.
The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low and the Turkish lira reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are both down about 1 percent.
The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low , and has slid 1 percent this week.

(Bloomberg) -- Dollar bulls suddenly are breathing more easily, finding succor in benchmark Treasury yields that brushed for the first time in four years.
While the psychologically important level has stoked speculation about which markets may be disrupted in the fallout, the looks to be one of the biggest winners. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is headed toward its best three-day advance since 2016, after languishing at multi-year lows. Treasury spreads are widening over their European and Japanese counterparts, renewing traders’ focus on currency pairs.
“The dollar has woken up a bit to rate differentials,” said James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, who has a long position versus the euro, yen, South Korean won and the . “The flow is all one-way, while the euro is starting to show signs of material fatigue.”
Treasury yields have advanced this year as the widening U.S. budget deficit -- set to surpass $1 trillion by 2020 -- has prompted a wave of fresh supply, while the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates at least another two times this year.
The 10-year yield has not surpassed 3 percent since January 2014. It was at 2.98 percent as of 7:55 a.m. in New York, pulling back from as high as 2.9957 percent earlier.
At the same time, the latest CFTC data suggest that the market is positioned for further weakness in the greenback, something that could prompt a squeeze in short positions. In the options market, sentiment on 10-year Treasury futures turned the most bearish since the February equities correction.
“The key to how the dollar performs going forwards probably depends on how markets react to a break of 3%” in 10-year yields,” wrote Kit Juckes, a global strategist at Societe Generale (PA: ) SA. “A clean break, unaccompanied by a pick-up in volatility and sell-off in risk assets, would force dollar shorts to capitulate and at the very least, severely test 1.2150.”
The euro headed toward that level on Monday, weakening 0.4 percent to $1.2239.
The European Central Bank meets this week, although analyst expectations are low that it will provide fresh clues about when officials will exit quantitative easing or raise the deposit rate for the first time since 2011.

(Bloomberg) -- The latest upheaval in President Donald Trump’s administration is moving the U.S. closer to sparking a global trade war that could send the dollar plunging, in the eyes of at least one investor.
The risk that the U.S. pivots toward more protectionist policies is increasing with the departure of moderate voices, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, said Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, which oversees about $83 billion.
He estimates the chances of a U.S.-led trade war are as high as 30 percent, and he sees that outcome pushing the about 12 percent weaker to $1.40 per euro within two years. If the U.S. inflames relations with its trading partners, particularly China, and other nations retaliate against American protectionism, investors will likely sell the greenback and seek shelter in the yen, Swiss franc and euro he said. Stocks also stand to suffer, he said.
“The dollar is the big loser,” the Boston-based money manager said in an interview. “The free marketers, the globalists, one by one, are leaving; the arguments are being won by the economic nationalists.”
It’s not just trade and politics that are weighing on the greenback. It’s fallen about 3 percent this year, extending a slide of almost 9 percent in 2017 that was fueled by the perception that other central banks would follow the Federal Reserve in withdrawing monetary stimulus.
Tillerson Trade
Traders sold the dollar and U.S. shares Tuesday on the news of Tillerson’s ouster, which followed Cohn’s last week after the president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In Wednesday trading, it was little changed at 106.30 yen and about $1.2360 per euro.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). strategists are looking past protectionism to broader reasons for dollar weakness, including an improving global economy and the prospect of tighter monetary policy outside the U.S. The firm says Trump’s tariffs still fall within the range of actions by previous presidents in the last 20 years, which didn’t spur trade wars.
However, U.S. politics appear to be driving investor sentiment. A gauge of U.S. political risk peaked this month in data going back to 2016, according to GeoQuant, an analytics firm in New York.
“Currency traders are bailing out of the dollar,” Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto, wrote in a note. “This confirms an extraordinary shift in psychology -- in the face of turmoil in the White House, the greenback appears to have lost its traditional safe-haven role, with the yen and euro acting as exit valves for fearful market participants.”"

Japanese stocks fell as the yen strengthened while investors prepared themselves for the economic damage that Hurricane Irma may inflict on Florida and mulled U.S. President Donald Trump’s most recent comments on North Korea.
(Bloomberg) -- The rally that’s made the yen 2018’s top performer among developed-market exchange rates will extend as speculators pick the Japanese currency over the euro to ride the ’s weakness, say analysts.
Piggybacking on an economy that’s expanded for eight straight quarters, the has stolen the limelight from the this year. The single currency’s gains have slowed after 2017 proved to be its best year in well over a decade amid bets the European Central Bank will scale back stimulus. Options traders are currently the most bullish on the yen among the Group-of-10 currencies.
“Focus is turning to the yen, with further euro-buying scope naturally being small after it was the strongest currency last year,” said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. Unlike the euro, being long in the yen isn’t yet a “crowded trade,” he said.
Leveraged funds have reduced net yen short positions for five straight weeks, the fastest pace since August, according to the latest CFTC data. In comparison, their net euro long positions declined by the most since September in the week to Feb. 13.
The yen reached 105.55 against the greenback on Friday, its strongest level since November 2016, as demand for haven assets rose amid a global stock rout. It has since weakened and was down 0.5 percent at 107.17 per dollar as of 9:15 a.m. in London.
There will always be a certain degree of long-dollar positions against the yen as Japanese margin traders and long-term investors buy the greenback on dips, said Naohiro Nomoto, manager of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
‘Toward 101’
Speculators still see betting on further yen appreciation as “profitable” as they eye 105, according to Kengo Suzuki, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Longer-term charts suggest a trend forming toward 101, driven by a combination of momentum, speculators’ positions and flows.”
The yen is laying the foundations for a move toward 100 against the dollar, technical charts show. The gains last week amplified the chances of a full reversal of the slide in late 2016, when it went from 100 to 118 per dollar after the U.S. election of Donald Trump.
The dollar-yen’s recent bounce may prove short-lived as the market is coming off a week where the pair underwent significant technical damage, with major lines of defense fractured, opening a door to the 101.20-100 area.
Some money managers too are wagering the Japanese currency will strengthen further. AMP Capital Investors Ltd.’s Nader Naeimi last week added to his long yen positions, while Singapore-based Kit Trading Fund Ltd., a hedge fund, is betting it will appreciate against the U.S. and New Zealand dollars.
While the yen jumped 3.7 percent in the last two weeks alone, Japan’s Finance Minister said Thursday that it hasn’t risen too abruptly to require intervention. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has been hovering near its lowest level since December 2014, weighed down by simmering U.S. trade tensions and concern over America’s deficits.
“Markets awash with dollars from U.S. fiscal expansion are driving dollar weakness now and prompting speculators to move the target to the yen,” said Koichi Takamatsu, head of G-10 currency trading for Japan at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. It’s unclear as to what would prompt Japanese authorities to step in, he said, adding that “if there is little reason to be sensitive at these levels, then it’s hard to see speculators shorting the yen.”

By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen jumped on Tuesday after the Bank of Japan trimmed its buying of long-dated Japanese government bonds in market operations, helping to stoke speculation about a future exit from its massive stimulus policy.
The yen rose about 0.4 percent to 112.62 yen to the dollar , bouncing back further from its two-week low of 113.40 per dollar touched on Monday.
""The BOJ's operation was a trigger for the yen's gains, although I suspect there were a lot of New Year flows given today was the first business day for quite a lot of people,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX/equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ).
""I think it is still too early for the BOJ to clarify its stance towards an exit from the current policy,"" he said.
The BOJ trimmed the amount it bought in Japanese government bonds of 10 to 25 years left to maturity and those of 25 to 40 years to maturity by 10 billion yen ($88.39 million) each from its previous operations. [L4N1P4168]
Since it adopted the yield curve control policy in 2016, the BOJ has occasionally tweaked its bond operations, with officials saying any changes are meant to keep bond yields in line with its policy goal and not to telegraph hints on its future policy.
While Tuesday's move was considered largely technical, it surprised some market players.

Analysts said a correction was inevitable for the common currency after its rally over the past couple months to near its 2017 peak of $1.2092, thanks to signs of acceleration in the euro zone economy.
Speculators' net long position in euro/dollar futures in Chicago reached a record high last week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday, pointing to potential for profit-taking.
""The euro is going through a consolidation after it had reached high levels above $1.2. Friday's euro zone inflation data was somewhat weaker than expected,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX and rates strategist at Barclays (LON: ).
""Going forward, the market's outlook depends more on U.S. factors, such as whether the Fed raises interest rates three times or more, and also the impact of the tax reform,"" he said.
While many Federal Reserve officials have said they expect three rate hikes this year, markets are not fully convinced as inflation remains tame despite very tight labor market conditions.
Indeed, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a voter on interest rate policy this year, said on Monday that the Fed may only need to raise interest rates two times in 2018 given weak price pressures.
Such doubts have held the down near its lowest levels since 2015 during the past few months.
The index stood at 92.239 ( ), after having fallen to 91.751 last week, not far from its 2-3/4-year low of 91.011 touched last September and way below its 2017 high of 102.26.
